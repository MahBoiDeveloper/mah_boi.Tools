BRIEF:ALL01|The Soviets have invaded. They outnumber us ten to one. You must assist special agent Tanya in New York. We are marshaling our forces as fast as we can, Commander, but we need time. A small American base, Fort Bradley, is in the New York area. If you can make contact, they may be able to assist in the defense of New York. Tanya will be moving through a chaotic battlefield. Keep your eye out for targets of opportunity and watch for new mission objectives. \n \n Objective 1: Destroy the Soviet Dreadnought fleet. \n \n Objective 2: Make contact with Fort Bradley. \n \n Objective 3: Keep Tanya alive.
BRIEF:ALL01MD|Looks like we have fallen out of the frying pan into the fire. We are about to fall under control of PsiCorp forces - their attack was sudden and nobody had idea about the Psychic Amplifier being constructed under the pavement of Washington DC nor about those in few other places around the world. Civilians left the city as soon as it was possible, especially those, who used to live near new PsiCorp basement. Capital looks like a city of ghosts now, although the evacuation did not allow us to move our forces and Soviet assailants which have also been taken over with the mind control powers of Yuri's device.\n\nDefeat of Yuri was not enough, PsiCorp hasn't been destroyed yet - their forces are swarming the United States and they must be stopped! Psychic Amplifier must be destroyed or else America will become controlled by the PsiCorp and nothing will be possible to be done in order to stop it from taking over the world, even without their master. Agent Tanya will assist you in this operation.\n\n Objective 1: Destroy the Psychic Amplifier.\n\n Objective 2: Eliminate PsiCorp forces.
BRIEF:ALL02|Soviet troops cover America like a foul plague. They have even penetrated our heartland to capture the Air Force Academy in Colorado. The Academy, its cadets, and the unique technology it contains are vital to our defense. Use Tanya to contact any American forces in the area, reclaim our Air Force Academy, and drive the Soviets from the area. \n \n Objective 1: Capture the Soviet-occupied Air Force Academy Chapel. \n \n Objective 2: Destroy all Soviet forces. \n \n Objective 3: Keep Tanya alive.
BRIEF:ALL02MD|With the Psychic Amplifier taken out from Washington DC, we have more time to plan an emergency movement neccessary due to the sudden attack of PsiCorp forces - we have received reports that Russia did not manage to protect themselves against unexpected technology PsiCorp introduced in their army - psychic illusion generators. It seems that Soviet countries are already under control of post-Yuri's army, even when their master is absent now and forever. It was a mistake not to deal with his force when we should have, but we still have possibility to correct that mistake.\n\nWhile you and Tanya have been leading operation in Washington, our secret force which hasn't been affected by Psychic Amplifier yet by then informed us about increased activity of PsiCorp's special force called African Empire, detected near the Valley of Kings in Egypt which was noticed.. few good months ago! Shame we have never received any reports in time, but as far as our satelittes are right - there is a African Empire base indeed and it looks like the forces deployed there are being prepared for assault over Africa. While Soviet survivors are now being evacuated from their countries to the United States, we must not allow African Empireto take over resources of Africa and turn people there into mindless slaves or their mutant force. Enemy forces in Africa must be eliminated before it's power rises, as we must limit it's activity to Asia only.\n\n Objective 1: Destroy all Slave Miners and the Grinder.\n\n Objective 2: Find and eliminate African Empire base.\n \n
BRIEF:ALL03|The Soviets have invaded Washington DC and have used their evil psychic technology to mind control our leaders. You must rescue them by destroying the Psychic Beacon near the White House. \n \n Objective 1: Destroy the Psychic Beacon.
BRIEF:ALL03MD|Commander, despite the fact that PsiCorp force in Africa is much weaker now and it will most likely no longer be able to continue expansion throughout the continent - we are still endangered. PsiCorp has Soviet force in their hands now, so even with Psychic Amplifier not affecting the United States, enemy can easily take over control in Europe, as well as attack our country from Cuba as it seems to be influenced by powers of another Psychic Amplifier deployed in the north of Brasil. While we are preparing for the salvation operation in Europe, we cannot let PsiCorp attack from the south and continue expansion of their force in South America. The device must be eliminated before the Cubans commence attack on the south of the United States.\n\nWhile at first sight the Psychic Amplifier appears to be the most dangerous threat at the moment - it appears that PsiCorp has already incorporated Soviet nuclear program into their army structure. We have located two Nuclear Missile Silos just few miles away from our primary target - those must be destroyed before the mind-controlling weapon. Once you remove the threat from the south, we will be able to continue warfare movements in Europe and Asia. There is still a lot to do Commander.\n\nObjective 1: Form a decent assault force.\n\nObjective 2: Destroy both Nuclear Missile Silos.\n\nObjective 3: Eliminate the Psychic Amplifier.
BRIEF:ALL04|Soviet forces continue to rampage across America. Our agents have discovered a large Psychic Amplifier in Chicago. If activated, this device will allow the Soviets to mind control all of North America. \n \n Objective 1: Force a shore landing and establish a base. \n \n Objective 2: Destroy the Psychic Amplifier before it comes online.
BRIEF:ALL04MD|Commander, though we have prevented PsiCorp from further colonisation into America and Africa, the threat may be bigger than we have expected!\n\nWe have recently received reports from our headquaters, that Yuri has NOT been defeated by the Soviets! Despite the fact that they assured us that he had been trapped in time, it appears that he somehow managed to return and while you were fighting with African Empire, Yuri himself made a transmission to White House and introduced his return just like he did for the first time. His come back is definitely connected with the accident that has taken place year ago - Prof. Einstein's Time Machine, which has been designed for research purposes has been stolen from the secret base in San Fransisco. Well, after spying out what was available in now destroyed PsiCorp bases - it appears that Time Machine has been stolen by the PsiCorp in order to rescue Yuri. We have managed to locate it.\n\nThe Time Machine along with another basement of PsiCorp is located on one of Caribbean islands - it couldn't be detected before, due to the stealth technology PsiCorp used. Now, when we know the general location thanks to files found in PsiCorp base in Brazil, the device must be eliminated! Prof. Einstein asked for this as he had realized how dangerous playing with time can be. Siege the islands with your fleet and then infiltrate them in order to find the device.\n\nObjective 1: Find and destroy the Time Machine.\n\nObjective 2: Eliminate PsiCorp forces.
BRIEF:ALL05|European forces still refuse to fight with us, fearing a Soviet nuclear counterattack. We have discovered the location of their medium-range missiles in Poland. Special agent Tanya has secretly crossed the Polish border. You will direct her to destroy the Soviet Nuclear Missiles. \n \n Objective 1: Infiltrate the Soviet Battle Lab. \n \n Objective 2: Neutralize the 2 Soviet Nuclear Missile Silos. \n \n Objective 3: Keep Tanya alive.
BRIEF:ALL05MD|Commander, after realizing how big his losses are, Yuri decided to withdraw most of his forces from the places where battles against us had taken place - they are probably operating in Russia now. \n\nWe got some information from spies we captured in Skaramagas Port - we now know that their master was and still is going to commence a massive assault over the Europe starting with a naval assault - Skaramagas battle was the first episode of the attack. The next one is Germany - using most of his enslaved Soviet forces Yuri will try to break through German/Polish border and start expansion in Europe. We can't ignore this threat as when the Soviets were stationing in conquered countries, there was no possibility to harden the defense lines. Even when our European Allies have managed to deal with most of Yuri's mind-controlled forces, the worst is yet to come.\n\nWe believe that Yuri is going to attack with Soviet brainwashed forces. Our satelitte systems have also located incoming forces - they will soon reach the border base which is the closest one to the Black Forest, where Prof. Einstein's lab used to be until Soviet forces destroyed it. Prof. Einstein is not ready for the evacuation yet as he is trying to collect most important plans of his projects and some of elements of the destroyed Chrono Sphere device, so the border must be protected at all costs!\n\nObjective 1: Protect the border.\n\nObjective 2: Destroy Yuri's Soviet base near Germany.
BRIEF:ALL06|The Europeans have joined with us and the time has come to counterattack. We will retake Washington DC and then we will retake the rest of our nation from the Soviet scum. \n \n Objective 1: Reinforce and assume command of Allied forces at the Pentagon. \n \n Objective 2: Destroy all Soviet forces in Washington.
BRIEF:ALL06MD|Commander, Yuri is surerly one piece of a megalomaniac - he has recently declared oneself to be the leader of the great worldwide army of Epsilon. Anyway, soon all his bases will belong to us. Thanks to your quick internvention in Germany, you allowed Prof. Einstein to be evacuated straight to Alaska where he's finishing his Chrono Sphere Device, which has been previously destroyed by the Soviet forces during the second Great War. The Chrono Sphere is now fully operational and so we can introduce the 'Chrono Storm' operation, which was supposed to abolish Romanov's reigme in Soviet Union, now against Yuri. We will commence full-scale assault into the heart of everything - Moscow, where Yuri operates in the Kremlin. Capturing him is the only effective way to stop his "Epsilon" from further activity.\n\nBefore we transport our forces straight to Moscow, we must find a decent place for deployment. We have sent our special Navy SEAL team to sabotage Epsilon defenses established in the Red Square. Eliminate them, and as soon as the Chrono Sphere and our reinforcements are ready - we will teleport them straight to the Red Square. Moscow is free of mind-controlled Soviet forces, but we presume that Yuri didn't call all of them to attack during the assault at Germany. We will try to find them as soon as possible. Good luck.\n \n Objective 1: Clear the area so Chrono Reinforcements can arrive. \n \n Objective 2: Eliminate Yuri's Elite Black Guard around the Kremlin.
BRIEF:ALL07|The Soviets still cover most of the globe. We must continue to fight them wherever they may be. A Soviet fleet has been discovered en route to Hawaii. Destroy this fleet and the Pacific will be ours. \n \n Objective 1: Destroy all Soviet forces.
BRIEF:ALL07MD|Commander, we did not inform the Soviets about the fall of Yuri's Epsilon yet. While our forces are trying to locate Yuri somewhere in the world, it appears that the Soviets had own plans for the fight against Yuri and maybe even against us.\n\nThe Soviets have somehow established a Psychic Amplifier in China, what allowed them to take control over the whole republic! With such power and after recapturing their homeland, the Soviets might be more dangerous than ever. We cannot let that happen, they can't defeat us again now, when we have such a chance for freedom. The device must be destroyed as soon as possible, before the Soviets manage to fully establish and command the army of Chinese.\n\nBefore we transport our MCV there, we must eliminate Chinese Airforce by capturing the Airfields. With no capability of using Mig fighters, the Construction Vehicle will be safer.\n\nObjective 1: Capture Soviet Airfields.\n\nObjective 2: Destroy the Psychic Amplifier.\n
BRIEF:ALL08|Even as we cleanse America of Soviet forces, they continue to play with their psychic technology, desperately hoping that their little toys will destroy us. We have discovered a Psychic Beacon in St. Louis. Take special agent Tanya in and destroy the beacon. \n \n Objective 1: Destroy the Soviet Psychic Beacon. \n \n Objective 2: Destroy all Soviet forces within St. Louis. \n \n Objective 3: Don't get Tanya killed.
BRIEF:ALL08MD|Commander, the situation with the Soviets is now stabilized. We have found Premier Romanov imprisoned in one of Epsilon camps in Russia, but he just moved from the cold prison on Siberia to a prison with better conditions in London. The Soviets have surrended and even sent us some reinforcements for the final battle against Yuri's legacy.\n\nDespite withdrawing it's forces from the falling Russia, the Epsilon was not able to prevent losses in it's army during the evacuation to Antarctica - it appears that the last active Epsilon fortress is located there. It is massive and well-protected but there is another trouble we will have to deal with - in it's middle there is some kind of huge tower built and it is even bigger than the Psychic Amplifier. We don't know what it is capable of, but Prof. Einstein warned us that it may be Yuri's ultimate response to his dominators' failure. Whether it's just an enhanced mind control device or something more dangerous we don't know, but we must attack. Eliminate his base and eliminate his maniacal ego.\n\nObjective 1: Destroy the Epsilon.\n\n
BRIEF:ALL09|The Soviets captured one of our west coast bases and with it one of our Prism Towers. We believe they may be trying to replicate that technology at a secret Soviet research facility in the Yucatan. A SEAL strike team is standing by, Commander, awaiting your orders. \n \n Objective 1: Capture or Destroy any Soviet attempts to replicate our Prism Technology. \n \n Objective 2: Eradicate the Soviet base defending their research site.
BRIEF:ALL0XMD|Commander, before our assault on Time Machine took place, Epsilon started to infiltrate our bases within the continent and collect as much data as they could before they died. We managed to capture most of his spies but then, Yuri got aware that his spies can do more bad than good for Epsilon. He killed most of his unloyal minions, who talked too much. We managed to keep group of them alive, in Skaramagas - one of our most important bases in Greece, which was built after Soviet invasion over Greece during the previous Great War - but they are no longer safe there as Yuri knows their position. We must transport them to safe location and get more information before Yuri continues his plans. You'll get control over Skaramagas navy as the city is Greek most important military port. Be aware though, as Yuri used drastic methods to eliminate spies he already killed.\n\nWhen spies are evacuated, we'll inform you as soon as possible of what to do next in this battle against Epsilon.\n\nObjective 1: Protect group of Yuri's spies.\n\nObjective 2: Escort spies to evacuation point.
BRIEF:ALL10|Desperate for some success, Soviet forces have counterattacked our European allies in Germany, moving deep into the Black Forest. No doubt their commanders hope that they will find and capture Einstein's laboratory. Your special talents have been asked for. The Germans fear they will be defeated without your strategic skills. \n \n Objective 1: Ensure the safety of Professor Einstein's laboratory. \n \n Objective 2: Destroy all Soviet forces.
BRIEF:ALL11|Einstein has found the perfect place for his Chronosphere. Unfortunately this location is very close to Soviet-controlled Cuba. Build the Chronosphere and clear the area of Soviet nuclear missiles. We are nearly ready for our final attack on Moscow. \n \n Objective 1: Build a Chronosphere. \n \n Objective 2: Neutralize the Soviet Nuclear threat on Cuba.
BRIEF:ALL12|The war is nearly at an end. A hand-picked group of volunteers will use the Chronosphere to invade Moscow from across the world. Once you have secured the Kremlin, Tanya will capture Romanov and put an end to Soviet aggression. You are the only commander skilled enough to make this work. Your forces will be outnumbered at least ten to one. Good luck. \n \n Objective 1: Clear the area so Chrono Reinforcements can arrive. \n \n Objective 2: Eliminate Romanov's Elite Black Guard around the Kremlin.
BRIEF:ERROR|Oops, there's no briefing for this mission. Examine MISSION.INI and RA2.STR for examples of how to do this.
BRIEF:MOC1A|Our satelittes located another Yuri's leftover base in Egypt. Epsilon collapsed in chaos after lost of their master seems to started fighting on it's own. Further development of their technology may even allow them to reconstruct the Psychic Amplifier in the sand canyon - we cannot let that happen!\n\nObjective: Destroy Epsilon base before Psychic Amplifier will be constructed.
BRIEF:MOC1S|Though Yuri has been trapped in time, Epsilon forces are still active. Recently, they have captured two Nuclear Missile Silos in Vladivostok, but they haven't armed them yet. If we will move to the city and strike at Epsilon bases, our outposts there will be most probably a targets for missile tests. Missile Silos MUST be destroyed!\n\nObjective: Destroy Nuclear Missile Silos and Epsilon bases.
BRIEF:MOC1Y|Thanks to your skills I have returned to this world commander. Neither Allies nor Soviets know that we are preparing for final assault, though Epsilon forces are still under attack of their armies. One of our bases in Cuba is being attacked by their forces, we must protect it as I have further plans to do with that basement.\n\nObjective: Destroy Soviet forces.
BRIEF:MOC2A|Though Yuri managed to invent a Genetic Mutator Device shortly before his failure, Epsilon managed to take the plans of construction away, to an island located on the Pacific. Two devices with limited range have been established there and it looks like that those are only remaining mutators on the world. Hopefully, the plans are also on that island. The only way to attack is using navy - we are prepared for it. Call Aircraft Carriers and Battleships to siege shore and island, use Destroyers to take out enemy fleet and protect navy with Aegis Cruisers. Due to their swimming abilities, Navy Seals might help you in infiltrating the base.\n\nObjective: Destroy Genetic Mutators and the base.
BRIEF:MOC2S|One of American bases in Mexico has been captured by Epsilon forces. They have started to develop genetic facilities and stealth technology there, probably to force an assault just after they will be able to rush the United States. Since all of Allies there are now under control of Epsilon, there is nothing else to do than destroying both bases before they strike at US. Allied reinforcements are on the way, but it will take too long before they arrive - we must attack now!\n\nObjective: Destroy Epsilon bases and stolen Allied structures.
BRIEF:MOC2Y|Foolish Soviets after defeating me myself thought that they can decrease their protection as there is no more danger... That allowed us to attack from side of Alaska. We have deployed some forces there which are ready for your commands. Destroy Soviet outposts guarding their "empire" so we will be able to move our Shadow Tanks and Mobile Illusions along to the Moscov.\n\nObjective: Destroy Soviet Outposts.
BRIEF:MOC3A|After Epsilon assault on Moscov, Soviets started to look for the signal emitted by the units which were equipped with sort of cloaking device. We got reports from their last hope outpost in Ural mountains, that Epsilon has another basement where the strongest signal comes from. We must make sure if it is not a preperation for a sneaky assault with those tanks. The cloaking devices called by Epsilon - Psychic Interrupters can be detected now by our new vehicles which terminate signal transfer - the Defenders. Those camouflaged robots can move as sneaky as the Epsilon's Shadow Tanks and reveal stealth secrets to our eyes. Remember about smaller and mobile versions of Psychic Interrupters - the Illusions. They can cloak smaller area but do not required power. Mobile Illusions also must be eliminated.\n\nObjective: Destroy Psychic Interrupters and cloaked base.
BRIEF:MOC3S|We have located yet another outpost of Epsilon on Greenland. This one seems to be bit better protected though, we don't know yet why. Reason of such defense may be a huge spinning tower located near the shore. The device is called Mental Omega and currently seems to be cooled down though we don't know what it's usage is yet. Device must be eliminated before we get to know.\n\nObjective: Eliminate Mental Omega Device.
BRIEF:MOC3Y|While I will be investigating into USSR, you commanders will try to take over one of strategy Allied bases in Canada. It is heavy protected but I am sure that you will be able to turn it into scrap quickly. Use advanced stealth technology to cloak yourself from enemies' eyes and use Shadow Tanks to attack sneakly. Remember to scan terrain before attacking with massive forces as there are lots of traps like Snipers or Grand Cannons in this temperate theatre.\n\nObjective: Eliminate Allied base.
BRIEF:SOV01|It is your good fortune to be in the vanguard of the Soviet assault on the United States. Lead your troops through Washington and destroy the most hated symbol of American military power, the Pentagon. \n \n Objective 1: Destroy the Pentagon.
BRIEF:SOV01MD|Moscow has been conquered by PsiCorp forces, which seem to continue massive assaults over their enemies even without their master. The attack on the capital was very sudden and we had no chances to deal with the enemy forces. Additionally, our units have encountered technology they have never seen before - tanks appearing suddenly out from nowhere and blasting everything aroung with energy rays. Nuclear Reactors have been sabotaged and without our radar systems working, division of stealth tanks surrounded the Kremlin and captured Romanov. Premier sent an order to retreat to Ural mountains before he was captured.\n\nSurvived forces from Moscov are on their way to the support base 4-G in Ural mountains. Our spy planes have already detected small PsiCorps camps there, and we know that enemy is chasing our survivors. We have to reach the fort quickly and protect ourselves, at least here in Ural, before we contact armies in other countries and inform about the possible danger. In this case we may have to mobilize divisions stationing in occuppied Allied nations.\n\nObjective 1: Reach the 4-G support base.\n\nObjective 2: Protect the fort.\n\nObjective 3: Destroy enemy forces.
BRIEF:SOV02|The Americans have foolishly gathered a fleet in a small harbor on the eastern coast of Florida. Assisted by General Vladimir in his Dreadnought, you will force a landing on the hostile shore and set up a base. When ready, you will strike out against the capitalist pigs and crush them under the iron heel of Soviet justice. \n \n Objective 1: Force a landing and set up a base. \n \n Objective 2: Destroy all enemy forces.
BRIEF:SOV02MD|Just after you established connection with 4-G we have received new data from our African ally - Libya. Reports say that PsiCorp forces attacked the country in the same time they assaulted Moscow. And just like the most of Soviet nations, Libya has been conquered by post-Yuri's force.\n\n The worst thing is, that PsiCorp has somehow located Libyan nuclear facilities in the Sahara desert. Facilities have been captured and two Nuclear Missile Silos as well. We still don't know what does PsiCorp plan to, because their movements are nowhere near being random, but it is sure that the silos can't stay in their hands! As we are not able to recapture them, due to the massive force in Libya, the silos must be destroyed!\n\nObjective 1: Eliminate two Nuclear Silos.\n\nObjective 2: Eliminate all Demolition Trucks.
BRIEF:SOV03|In order to complete our psychic beacon, we will need to capture some American technology. Lead your forces into New York and capture their Battle Lab. Then build a Psychic Beacon to take control of the city. \n \n Objective 1: Capture the American Battle Lab. \n \n Objective 2: Build and defend a Psychic Beacon.
BRIEF:SOV03MD|Yes comrade, this is confirmed. PsiCorp has reconstructed Psychic Amplifiers and deployed three of them - one in Libya, one in Moscov and one in Washington. We still don't get how did you manage to escape from the Libyan one's influence, but this is not the best time to discuss it. The situation looks very bad. It must be said that we have been nearly defeated by the PsiCorp force, but if the Allies fall under control of Psychic Amplifiers, there will be no hope for recapturing the Kremlin and bringing Soviet Union back to it's glory.\n\nOnce again we fight for the Allies' dirty business. We have sent Boris and Chitzkoi to Washington, to help you in this operation. Chitzkoi - the robotic hound who supported the first Great War cybernetic hero Volkov - has been recreated and upgraded by our sciencists so it can fully resist powers of the Dominator, as he is a machine, but Boris won't stay invulnerable to PsiCorp brainwasher for too long. You must act quickly or else Boris will be the other one who joins PsiCorp in the war for domination. You may encounter some resistance of mind-controlled Allied forces, but remember that Boris' gun and Chitzkoi's teeth are together the key to victory. Also remember, that both of them can resist basic mind-control tricks of PsiCorp.\n \nObjective 1: Destroy the Psychic Amplifier.\n\nObjective 2: Finish off PsiCorp forces.\n
BRIEF:SOV04|The foolish Koreans have decided to take sides with the failing Allies. Their cowardly attempt to invade our Eastern territories will surely fail. Defend the motherland and, when you are ready, push the Koreans back into the ocean. \n \n Objective 1: Establish a base. Defend the homeland. \n \n Objective 2: Destroy all enemy forces.
BRIEF:SOV04MD|The worst has happened - Yuri seems not to be defeated and we have no idea how he could return from the warp trap. USSR has fallen - when you destroyed the Psychic Amplifier in Washington, Yuri has deployed similar device in our homeland. We have no longer access to 4-G support base, but luckily, some of our forces have been moved to America. We must be careful of the Allies and their spies as even when we are in the alliance, we can't trust them. And don't ask us where our settlement is now. It's secret. Yuri's listening.\n\nYuri has formed a massive divisioned army - the Epsilon. Shameful to say, with it's forces spread across the globe, Yuri became a threat more dangerous than Soviet Union ever was.\n\nExcept for America and Canada, the only independent country is China. We must create an alliance with our post-neighbour before Epsilon conquers it, because North America won't be invulnerable for Epsilon attacks forever. The problem is that after the first Great War, China is not so trustful to other countries and the Republic isolated itself from international discussions and cooperation. If Epsilon attacks, they will most probably try to protect their country on their own but alone, they don't stand a chance against psychic forces and power of the Psychic Amplifier.\n\nIn the land of Xizang, we have once deployed a Psychic Amplifier during the second war against the Allies. Premier Romanov sent Yuri to China where he was supposed to construct a device able to mind control whole Chinese nation, so the warfare would not be needed. Yuri has never contacted us from there though, he vanished to appear months later with own army. What you have to do, is capture the Psychic Amplifier and activate it, so China will fall under our control. We are not able to do a fast assault on it from air though, because cargo planes can't reach Chinese air zone unnoticed, our special Spy Planes can and unlike the Chinese - we don't have a specialised air armada due to the restrictions we got after losing the first Great War. We have to strike quickly and sneakly.\n\n Objective 1: Capture and power up the Psychic Amplifier.\n
BRIEF:SOV05|The European nations are planning to join with the crippled Americans. We must not let this act of aggresion go unpunished. You will lay waste to their beautiful Paris. We will show the Allies the true meaning of power by turning their own precious monuments into weapons of mass destruction. \n \n Objective 1: Energize the PARIS TOWER with 3 TESLA TROOPERS. \n Objective 2: Defend the PARIS TOWER from Allied attack. \n Objective 3: Defeat all remaining Allied troops.
BRIEF:SOV05MD|Comrade, you did excellent job with recapturing Chinese Military Headquaters. With China under our control, Soviet technology has been successfully enriched with their very useful equipment. Once again, we managed to fully reconstruct our great airforce, due to the large number of Mig fighters Chinese have. Also, their completed researches on the electromagnetic waves and general electronics allowed them to invent such devices like Infector Tanks, which can easily immobilize enemy units, Emperor Tanks with few Hackers inside playing with the advanced mobile computer system which allows them to take over enemy structures and sole Hackers with their handy laptops, who can disable power in defense structures when deployed.\n\nIn the Military Headquaters of Beijing, we have also found plans for a special superweapon Chinese were about to construct in danger of another world war - the Centurion Siege Crawler. According to documents found in the building, this machine is being constructed in one of special basements in Tibet, where also one of the primary Chinese airbases is located. Centurion is a huge mechanical robot, totally automatized - designed to fire massive cannonballs at great ranges. It's great armor and terrific weapon can be very useful in the war against Yuri. This walker can be the only way to siege the Kremlin without getting brainwashed and capture Yuri once and forever as it is something to be reckoned with.\n\nHowever, Yuri's Infiltrators are everywhere, and additionally - they are immune to the powers of our Psychic Amplifier. The research facility in Tibet must be protected at all costs!\n \n Objective 1: Protect the research facility.\n\n Objective 2: Destroy all Epsilon forces in the area.\n
BRIEF:SOV06|The Americans are on their knees, begging for mercy. The last remnants of their fleet at Pearl Harbor waits helplessly for your relentless attack. However, we have news that the Koreans are not yet beaten and may attempt to join up with the American Navy. They must not succeed. \n \n Objective 1: Establish a base in the Hawaiian Islands. \n \n Objective 2: Destroy the Allied Navy.
BRIEF:SOV06MD|We have successfully incorporated the Centurion Siege Crawler and Chinese technology into the equipment of our army. Centurion is now being escorted on it's way to Moscow in order to siege the Kremlin again, kill the traitor and rescue Romanov as well as our motherland.\n\nWe have encountered some heavier Epsilon resistance by the border between China and USSR, which requires your immediate intervention. The problem is, that the frontline is being protected with Yuri's psychic illusion, which was the main reason of USSR fall. We cannot move our forces there just like that, because some of units has already been surprised and trapped by so-called Shadow Tanks, which are invisible for Epsilon enemies unless they strike with two of their psionic emitters. The frontline must be cleared and the Centurion must be safely transported to USSR, before Yuri creates more of his tricks. We are on our final way for freedom Comrade, you must not fail!\n\nOn a side note, you may find it useful that Infector Tanks' electromagnetic waves can scramble up effects of Yuri's psychic illusion devices.\n \n Objective 1: Destroy Epsilon frontline.\n \n Objective 2: Protect the Centurion.\n
BRIEF:SOV07|The Americans have engaged their Chronosphere; a device that allows them to move soldiers across great distances almost instantly. They can now strike anywhere they wish. You must defend our Battle Lab in the Ural mountains. The Americans will surely strike there soon in a desperate but doomed attempt to shut down our development of the ultimate battle tank. \n \n Objective 1: Defend your Battle Lab at all costs.
BRIEF:SOV07MD|Comrade, the siege over the Moscov can be more difficult than we have expected. Yuri's base is very massive and well-protected, so is the Kremlin itself. To make things even worse, Epsilon has Psychic Amplifier in it's hands, not even mentioning stealth technology, the Iron Curtain and Genetic Mutator.\n\nYuri is in the Kremlin. Your objective is simple - you must destroy the Kremlin and Epsilon base in Moscow, so we will bring back the glory to mother Russia. This mission will be difficult, but we hope you will be able to command our last-chance army in this battle for freedom!\n \n Objective 1: Destroy the Kremlin.\n\n Objective 2: Destroy the Epsilon.\n\n Warning - Centurion must not be destroyed.
BRIEF:SOV08|Even in the hour of our greatest victory, General Vladimir has turned against us. Tempted by the soft American lifestyle, he has gone rogue and convinced many loyal communists to turn against us. You must go to Washington DC and dig Vladimir out of his wretched hole. \n \n Objective 1: Capture the White House.
BRIEF:SOV08MD|Comrade, Yuri was fooling us all the time. While we were busy trying to destroy the Psychic Amplifiers and siege the Kremlin, he has been introducing his real plan into life in his secret Antarctican base!\n\nWe are free, but we aren't going to be free for too long if we don't do something. We have to destroy the device he constructed in the snows of Antarctica - the device he protects like nothing before.\n\nObjective: Destroy the Mental Omega Device.
BRIEF:SOV09|Our victory is near at hand. The President has successfully eluded us, but we have tracked him to a dirty little fort called 'The Alamo' in San Antonio, Texas. You must use our Psi-Corp Troopers to mind control the President and force him to surrender the United States. \n \n Objective 1: Use Mind-Control to capture the President.
BRIEF:SOV0XMD|Luckily, we catched a squadron of Chinese Migs nearby so we were able to prevent Yuri from using nuclear missiles against our Psychic Amplifier. On the other hand, we now know that his forces are active in China as well, although in smaller amounts.\n\nComrade, we did not intend to activate the Psychic Amplifier for men-power and terrain only. The Chinese can use such advanced technologies and powerful airforce that we started to wonder how came they didn't start any military movements - luckily for us though. You could see an example of their military during the assault over Yuri's Nuclear Silo - Chinese lead in airforce, they exceed even South Koreans as far as air technologies are concerned and this fact is very promising for us. After losing the first Great War, we were abolished to construct any aircrafts - that's why we had to trick the Allies with Kirov Airships. Now, when Yuri's Epsilon rise to power - there is no need to keep fullifying the treaty, but we are not able to create air armada on our own and neither we are able to explore new technologies. We have to implement Chinese military projects into our army.\n\nWe have to infiltrate Chinese Military Headquaters in Beijing closer. You could say that with Psychic Amplifier there is no need to do this, as HQ are already under our control. Well, there still is a reason to send our forces to Beijing and that reason has a name - Yuri. He was quicker than us and his forces, which are naturally immune to powers of our Psychic Amplifier, captured the Headquaters building already. It must be recaptured. We need to know if there are other Chinese inventions that could help us in the war against Yuri. We sent Boris to the city, the North Koreans are also providing you with their forces which will arrive soon at the coast, which is closest to Military Headquaters.\n\n Objective 1: Recapture and protect Military HQ.\n\n Objective 2: Destroy enemy forces.
BRIEF:SOV10|In their final desperate hours, the Allies have managed to produce one last bit of super-technology. They have a Weather Control Device which they can use to create terrible storms that can sink fleets and level cities. We believe they have hidden their doomsday weapon in the isolated US Virgin Islands. \n \n Objective 1: Capture the American Battle Lab to locate the Weather Control Device. \n \n Objective 2: Destroy the Weather Control Device.
BRIEF:SOV11|Yuri has turned against us. There is only one answer for such treason. \n \n Objective 1: Destroy Yuri's headquarters - The Kremlin.
BRIEF:SOV12|We have found the last feeble Allied stronghold. Their Chronosphere, now fully operational, can move soldiers anywhere in the world. They can strike at us in New York, in Prague, even in Moscow. Yuri's files show the device is located near Point Hope, Alaska. You must take what few forces we have in the area and lead an attack, before the Allies make use of their cowardly technology. This is the final hour, commander. Glory awaits. \n \n Objective 1: Destroy the Chronosphere.
BRIEF:TRN01|What an irony, isn't it comrade general? Once upon a time you abolished my great plans and used the Time Machine to interrupt me again and one day, you wake up, come to Premier Romanov's office and who do you find?\n\nIt isn't a dream comrade, it is a nightmare. Moscow is ours and soon, the whole Soviet Union and Soviet countries will belong to me. Even sooner than the whole world so it seems the domination of Hammer and Sickle is still far away from true. And now it will never be. You have a choice - you can join us, because I know what your skills are or you can deny my offer, but it will be your last free will in your life.\n\nPremier Romanov has escaped - he must be captured, before he leaves the city. Oh, the city? The Soviet base inside must be destroyed. What are you waiting for, general? I'm your premier now.\n\nObjective 1: Capture Premier Romanov.\n\nObjective 2: Destroy Soviet base in Moscow.\n
BRIEF:TRN02|You destroyed my submarine base and captured rocket launchpad few months ago, here in Tibrena Island. The Soviets also found my cloning projects here, so as you may know, they have established own cloning facilities in the area. My technicians have been working on a secret artifical island base near the Tibrena - thanks to my excellent stealth technology, Soviets couldn't find it even with their submarines. Now it is time to strike.\n\nGive me back, what is mine. I have bigger plans concerned with this island.\n\nObjective 1: Recapture Cloning Vats.\n\nObjective 2: Destroy the Soviet base.
BRIEF:TRN03|While two sideforces of my army - Indian Dominions and African Empire are going to deal with the rest of Soviet countries, you and me are going to take control over the Allied nations - they have surerly been warned about the danger. I'll tell you a secret as now, when you are at my orders you know only what I say - there is a Psychic Amplifier already constructed and activated in Washington DC, but that one has only been made in order to distract Allied and Soviet forces, which keep evacuating survivors from Europe through the ocean. The true target and perfect place for primary "American" Psychic Amplifier is located in the middle of United States - in a city called Fort Collins. \n\nFar during multiple storms, on the island you have recently recaptured I have created my almost perfect genetically modified soldier - Rahn. He was sent to the position. Call him to mutate civilians into loyal Brutes with his Terranova railgun prototype and form an army in order to collect enough money for construction of the device. Use Epsilon Adepts to capture civilian and Allied units around the city.\n\nObjective 1: Collect enough money.\nObjective 2: Construct Psychic Amplifier.\nObjective 3: Defend the Psychic Amplifier.\nObjective 4: Destroy Allied forces in Fort Collins.\nObjective 5: Don't let Rahn die.
BRIEF:TRN04|It seems that our Psychic Amplifier was not powerful enough to take control over the whole United States. President Dugan and his security force have escaped to the Alamo fort in San Antonio.\n\nIndian Dominion and African Empire are progressing with the Soviet defeat very well, they have established basements in many countries but that's still not enough. America is one of last targets to be conquered - capture President Dugan with mind control so the Allied soul will be killed for once and forever. Be warned commander, as it seems that the Allies are transporting some support forces to the Alamo with a reconstructed Chrono Sphere Device. We will track it down soon though.\n\nObjective 1: Capture President Dugan with mind control.\n\nObjective 2: Escort him to the warehouses.
BRIEF:TRN05|The Soviet Russia shall no longer be named the Soviet one as it was completely dominated by my force - I have established a Psychic Amplifier in Moscow. On the other hand, our progressive expansion starts to frighten the Allies. In case of too much losses, they commited a desperate movement and they recaptured one of our bases - unluckily, the one with the Time Machine my forces used in order to find me trapped in the Jurrassic age and bring me back. I assume that they are forming a special salvation force, so they can move it back to the past and fight with my weaker forces ratherthan fighting against an enemy who has almost total domination.\n\nWe are in trouble comrade and so you are. If the Allies continue research upon our latest technologies and use them against us in the past - we may be defeated. Allied forces must be stopped.\n\nObjective 1: Destroy the Time Machine.\nObjective 2: Destroy Allied forces.\n
BRIEF:TRN06|Comrade, we have found location trajectories of the Allied Chrono Sphere - it is located in Alaska. The documents attached to the secret plans found in Alamo said about the so called 'Chrono Storm' operation, which was supposed to be launched at Moscow in order to free Allied nations from Soviet dictatorship. As the Soviets destroyed the Chrono Sphere prototype in Black Forest in Germany, Einstein had to continue his work in the further and better defended location.\n\nThe Psychic Amplifier hasn't reached the last free American state, and as our secret weapon isn't ready yet - we have to react as soon as possible, before Allies prepare the chrono assault against our army. Though the Time Machine was destroyed, I presume that the emergency plan was to fight against our forces in these times in case of the Time Machine failure. Infiltrate the Allied Tech Center in order to locate the direct position of device using our Infiltrators but be warned, as Allied Defenders are everywhere and they can detect them. Then, take out the Chrono Sphere, and destroy Allied forces.\n\nObjective 1: Infiltrate Allied Tech Center.\n\nObjective 2: Destroy Allied Chrono Sphere Device.\n\nObjective 3: Destroy Allied forces.
BRIEF:TRN07|This is a wonderful day for the Epsilon comrade! With the Allied Chrono Sphere device destroyed, I can feel safer now again and keep my plans going further from the Kremlin which became a fortress which neither the Soviets nor Allies can break now.\n\nI had even more luck with locating a funny coexistence of Allied and Soviet forces which have not been corrupted by our psychic powers yet and yes it is in fact Korea. While the South one belongs to the Alliance, the North one joined the World Soviet Alliance few months ago, before the final strike of Epsilon. In spite of the fact that the Soviets have taken control over the Allies, Premier Romanov was preparing a support assault over the South Korea, which would help the North one to conquer it's neighbour. Although after our ambush this has never happened and both Allies and Soviets have coalised again - Koreas refused to.\n\nDon't bother with leading a massive assault over the Korea commander. Start the destructive conflict between neighbours, so we will ambush them from the inside and quickly deal with our last enemies as it appears that each of Koreas is preparing own battle against us. They don't want to ally, but they don't want to fight against each other anymore. Let's change the situation. And when you deal with this problem, the world will be ours to command and conquer!\n\nObjective 1: Sabotage Allied Ore Purifier and Airforce Command Headquaters.\n\nObjective 2: Sabotage Soviet Iron Curtain Device and Nuclear Reactor.\n\nObjective 3: Destroy Allied and Soviet forces in their chaos.\n\nHINT - Try capturing some of enemy buildings in order to get more force.
BRIEF:TRN08|Comrade, despite the fact that the Allies have surrended, we got them under our control ultimately thanks to the Psychic Amplifier established in Korea. This doesn't mean that we have finally won with Soviets though. It appears that some of their forces managed to escape from conquered countries and set up a secret basement in Tibet.\n\nRelying on the information our Infiltrators managed to aquire, the last Soviet fortress covers a secret weapon and the only hope for the world to break off our domination. In association with Chinese sciencists, the Soviets have created dangerous superweapon - the Centurion Siege Crawler - a huge walker armed with powerful cannon, which can resist our mind control and abolish my leadership conquering the Kremlin on it's own! We cannot let this happen! Eliminate the machine and see the hope of enslaved people burning in hell!  Lead the Epsilon to the ultimate domination Comrade, for once and forever!\n\nObjective 1: Destroy the Centurion Siege Crawler.\n\nObjective 2: Destroy Soviet forces.
BRIEF:TRN09|Objective: Destroy the Mental Omega.
BRIEF:TRN0X|Comrade, as you may remember - I had a space rocket launchpad there nearby Tibrena island you once stole and used to eliminate my secret moon base. While we have recaptured the island, I ordered you to destroy the launchpad so the Soviets will not be able to get support from their moon base. It looks like though that they have a whole cosmoport located in Siberia. We haven't activated the Psychic Amplifier in Russia yet and I presume that the Soviets will launch a space-based assault soon, using launchpads for nuclear attacks as well. Their Relikt space station may also be used against our communication and targeting systems around the globe so we have to cut the connection with it and the moon base.\n\nThe spaceport consists of a supply center, Cosmonaut training center and three launchpads - all built on a peninsula which is inaccessible through ground due to multiple snowstorms and difficult conditions. We will strike from skies and water but we won't be able to establish a base there. You'll have to act with the forces we will be able to transport there. Capture enemy structures to enhance your power in force.\n\nObjective 1: Establish an outpost.\n\nObjective 2: Destroy Soviet Cosmonaut training camp.\n\nObjective 3: Destroy Soviet supply center.\n\nObjective 4: Destroy 3 Soviet launchpads.\n\nObjective 5: Eliminate enemy forces.

COOP:CAMP11|The Soviets have invaded Texas! Stop them.
COOP:CAMP11V|Commander's Log -Texas, USA: The first Soviet unit to enter the United States was the Russian 2nd Motorized Rifle Division. They quickly set up bases in Southern Texas from which they could strike at US strategic assets all across the Southwest. American forces were quickly overwhelmed and it soon looked as though Russian and Cuban divisions would occupy all major cities in the southern US. Only a few diehard American commanders stood in the way.
COOP:CAMP12|Soviet and Cuban forces are striking into Alabama. Destroy them.
COOP:CAMP12V|Commander's Log - Alabama, USA: In the 2nd week of the war, despite massive loses, Soviet and Cuban forces attempted to link their battle lines in Alabama. Though their resources were nearly depleted, American commanders managed to put up a stiff resistance.
COOP:CAMP13|Cuban forces have invaded Florida. Push them back into the sea.
COOP:CAMP13V|Commander's Log - Florida, USA: While Russian forces raged across the Old South, Cuban forces quickly invaded Florida. Their first attacks were successful, however the Cubans met with grass-roots resistance when American commanders managed to procure a few MCVs from European blockade-runners.
COOP:CAMP14|Soviet forces threaten Atlanta. Find and destroy their supply base.
COOP:CAMP14V|Commander's Log - Georgia, USA: In the 4th week of the war, Russian and Cuban forces gathered in the Georgian countryside. Their mission was simple, gather resources, replenish two badly damaged Soviet divisions and then rage into the undefended city of Atlanta. The Soviet policy was clear, resistance must be punished and the American rebels must be taught a lesson. Before the Soviets were ready, a British spy sent word of the attack to American Commanders and battle was joined.
COOP:CAMP15|The Soviets have a network of bases along the Mexican border. Destroy them to end the war.
COOP:CAMP15V|Commander's Log - Texas, USA: As the Soviets were pushed back out of the United States, the last survivors of the battle for Texas laid siege to a mighty Russian battle fortress on the Mexican border. From this base the Soviets could make air and nuclear strikes deep into the United States. The Soviet base had to be destroyed, no matter what the price.
COOP:CAMP21|Strike a blow for freedom, your forces are in Romania, destroy all Soviet forces.
COOP:CAMP21V|Commander's Log - Eastern Europe: While the Soviets were striking against America, the Europeans remained silent. When the Soviets nuked Chicago, the Europeans prayed the war would not come to their shores, but when the Soviets attacked Paris, even the most cautious commander knew that the time had come for war. It was a combined French and German force that struck the first blow into Eastern Europe, led by the most aggressive European commanders on the continent.
COOP:CAMP22|The Soviets have counterattacked into Germany. You must hold the line.
COOP:CAMP22V|Commander's Log - Eastern Europe: Despite their initial success, the Allies soon found themselves surrounded on all sides by entrenched Soviet forces. Soviet units quickly cut off any chance of retreat in Romania and the Allied expeditionary force was forced to fight their way back to friendly battle lines.
COOP:CAMP23|You have been ordered to seize control of the Black Sea and her harbors.
COOP:CAMP23V|Commander's Log - Romania: As weeks stretched into months, the Allies tired as Europe was once again a grim battleground for the most powerful nations on earth. Eager to take the battle to the enemy, the Allies sent their best commanders into the Mediterranean to seize control of vital island strongholds and prepare large fleets for an attack into the Black Sea.
COOP:CAMP24|In a surprise attack, your forces have been sent into Poland. Crush the unprepared Soviets.
COOP:CAMP24V|Commander's Log - Poland: With the Soviets distracted by a major amphibious landing on their own shores, Allied forces seized the opportunity to make a major armored attack into Poland. In the 4th month the Allies lead their forces across the Rhine at the dead of night in the middle of winter, taking the Soviet bases completely by surprise.
COOP:CAMP25|The drive into Russia has begun. Your forces are in the Ukraine and face a desperate Red Army.
COOP:CAMP25V|Commander's Log - Ukraine, Soviet Union: With most of Europe still weak from battle, two European commanders took it upon themselves to put an end to the war in Europe by striking against the main Soviet Headquarters inside the Russian border. Without authorization or approval from their governments, these commanders gathered what forces remained and struck what they hoped would be a final blow.
COOP:CAMP31|Destroy all Soviet forces along the Sea of Japan.
COOP:CAMP31V|Commander's Log - Japan: The Korean government remained neutral during the first few months of the war until a Korean reporter learned that the Soviets had used Psychic Technology to mind control key members of the Korean leadership. When the story broke Korea went to war, and her commanders were to fight in almost every country in the Far East. The first attack took the Soviets almost completely by surprise as the Koreans fought along the coast of Japan for naval supremacy of the Pacific.
COOP:CAMP32|Defend Vietnam from Soviet aggression.
COOP:CAMP32V|Commander's Log - Vietnam: As the Soviets continued to spread across South East Asia, consuming the small countries that stood in their way, the Korean Army dispatched two divisions to Vietnam to defend it against a major Soviet strike force. The Korean commanders were outnumbered almost two to one and knew that only superior leadership would save them from certain defeat.
COOP:CAMP33|Your home nation, Korea is threatened, defend your lands at any cost.
COOP:CAMP33V|Commander's Log - Republic of Korea: Three weeks after declaring war on the Soviet Union, Korean commanders faced an invasion of their own country by a secret Soviet division hidden from their intelligence network by powerful psychic technology. Using what forces remained in country the Koreans marched to their own border and prepared to make the Soviets pay for every inch of ground.
COOP:CAMP34|Invade the frozen wastes of eastern Russia and destroy the Soviet bases.
COOP:CAMP34V|Commander's Log - Harbin, Soviet Union: With most of the Soviet forces in the Far East neutralized or destroyed the Korean High Command ordered their generals to take the fight to the enemy and Korean forces invaded the frozen wastes of Eastern Russia.
COOP:CAMP35|Complete your invasion of Siberia and destroy the Soviet supply bases that fuel war effort.
COOP:CAMP35V|Commander's Log - Siberia, Soviet Union: Despite massive losses to battle and the bitter cold, the Korean invasion force was not deterred and moved quickly against the oil fields of eastern Siberia. With the invasion in America going poorly for the Soviets and the European Allies attacking into Russia herself, the Koreans had a unique opportunity to deliver a crippling blow to the Soviet war machine. Korea had a chance to make a huge difference in the overall war.
COOP:CAMP41|Your legions have invaded Italy. Destroy all who oppose you.
COOP:CAMP41V|Commander's Log - Italy: While the Russians managed to persuade a few pariah warlord states to join their cause, most were only in the war for their own gain. It was a chance for many warlord nations to prey upon their neighbors, to expand their borders and to seize the resources they needed to maintain their failing economies. While Soviet forces fought around the globe, Iraq and Libya seized the opportunity for a joint invasion of southern Italy. Only a pitiful few French and English forces opposed them.
COOP:CAMP42|Greece is our next target. Destroy any Allies who dare to oppose our conquest.
COOP:CAMP42V|Commander's Log - Greece: As the English and French rallied their forces at the Alps the combined forces of the Iraqi and Libyan armies smashed into Greece. The Grecian army was overrun in a matter of days but a combined French and British force brought by boat from India and French Malaysia managed to put up a token resistance.
COOP:CAMP43|The French and English have counterattacked in Italy. Destroy their advanced bases.
COOP:CAMP43V|Commander's Log - Italy: Their supply lines overextended and their armies scattered across southern Europe, the Libyans and Iraqis were vulnerable to an Allied counterattack. In the 3rd week of the war the French and English attacked, striking at the ports of southern Italy in an attempt to cut-off Iraqi forces from their naval supply lines.
COOP:CAMP44|The Allies have paradropped into the fertile plane just outside Baghdad. Destroy them.
COOP:CAMP44V|Commander's Log - Iraq: After their failed attack, the Allies tried one last desperate gamble in the 4th week of the war. While Libyan death squads hunted down Allied troops in the Italy war-zone, the English and French took what forces they had remaining and made a massive airdrop in the fertile river basin outside of Baghdad, hoping to set up bases to siege the city.
COOP:CAMP45|The French have built a massive fortress in northern Greece. This is the last point of resistance.
COOP:CAMP45V|Commander's Log - Greece: Assisted by French base defenses, the Allies built a massive fortress in their last remaining stronghold of northern Greece. The French and English held out for nearly three weeks before the Iraqi and Libyan armies sent in their most battle-hardened commanders to find a way to break through the Allied defenses.
COOP:CAMP51|Destroy the Russian fleets and naval bases in the North Sea.
COOP:CAMP51V|Commander's Log - North Sea: While the Soviet army was busy crushing American resistance on the Eastern Seaboard, the Soviet Navy fought a bloody battle to cross the North Atlantic and deliver supplies and reinforcements to their troops. The first battles were fought on tiny islands in the North Sea where combined Allied forces attempted to hold back the Soviet battle groups and destroy any bases the Soviets managed to build.
COOP:CAMP52|The Soviets have invaded Norway. We must save this ally from Soviet dominion.
COOP:CAMP52V|Commander's Log - Norway: The initial Allied success prompted an immediate and brutal response from the Soviets. Threatened by superior Allied naval forces, the Soviets invaded the neutral countries of Sweden and Norway to lay claim to the warm water ports that would allow them to build large fleets and strike anywhere along the northern coast of Europe. The Allies gathered their best commanders and with only a handful of forces, sent them into Norway to hold back the Soviet horde.
COOP:CAMP53|A secret Soviet base has been discovered in the British Isles. Destroy it before it is too late.
COOP:CAMP53V|Commander's Log - British Isles: As the Soviets became more desperate to deliver war materials to their failing armies in America, they began to try more devious means of breaking the Allied blockade in the North Atlantic. In the 3rd month of the war, a small Soviet force made a secret landing in northern Britain and set up a base. By the time the Allies discovered the Soviet presence, it was nearly too late.
COOP:CAMP54|The Soviets have swept into Germany. Stop their advance and destroy their forces.
COOP:CAMP54V|Commander's Log - Germany: As the war entered its 4th month the Allies grew bold and began major attacks into Poland from Austria, striking against Soviet bases and liberating thousands of Polish civilians. The Soviets responded quickly with three armored divisions that swept into eastern Germany, cutting off the Allied attackers. The battle quickly degenerated into a chaotic base versus base duel, with the outcome sure to change the course of the war in Europe.
COOP:CAMP55|Victory is close at hand, destroy the Soviet naval bases in the Baltic to end the war for the North Atlantic.
COOP:CAMP55V|Commander's Log - Northern Baltic Sea: Victory after victory had brought the Allies into the Northern Baltic where they hoped to destroy the Soviet naval bases that continually reinforced the Soviet North Atlantic fleet. The Allies were only able to spare a few forces from their blockade groups for the assault, leaving them outnumbered three to one in what they hoped would be the final battle of the North Atlantic campaign.

GUI:OVERPARMSGALL01|You barely succeeded in holding back the Soviet advance.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL01MD|Even when we got some time for further dismantelement of PsiCorp, lack of control over the United States surerly won't stay unnoticed.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL02|Your grinding assault cost hundreds of lives but liberated the Air Force Academy.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL02MD|Though PsiCorp enslaving facilities and the Grinder have been destroyed there in Egypt, PsiCorp without doubts took some of Theban civilians away for own purposes.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL03|The President was rescued, though many military secrets were compromised.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL03MD|Though PsiCorp has been driven away from the Brazil, this surerly wasn't last of their nuclear facilities.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL04|The Psychic Amplifier was destroyed, but not before the Soviets gained valuable test data about it's effects. In spite of the tragic loss of Chicago, however, you've saved our entire nation from falling under the influence of the Soviets' most powerful psychic weapon.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL04MD|You have destroyed the Time Machine and Nuclear Silo, but now it will no longer be safe to go into the water.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL05|The missiles have been destroyed. Other Soviet missiles have been moved deep inside the USSR.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL05MD|Even when Yuri's assault has been stopped, Yuri surerly had enough time to hide his forces and start preperations for another attack.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL06|Washington DC has been saved, but at a terrible price in men and materials.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL06MD|USSR capital has been liberated but Yuri himself has not been captured! It appears that our chase hasn't finished yet.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL07|Pearl Harbor has been saved, but the Hawaiian islands have been devestated by the Soviet onslaught.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL07MD|Though the Psychic Amplifier has been destroyed, the Chinese want to know what the heck has happened.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL08|Saint Louis was saved, but thousands of American citizens were permanently turned to the Soviet cause.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL08MD|Though Mental Omega Device has been destroyed and Yuri captured, we and Soviet forces had massive losses during the battle. No matter, the world is now safe.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL09|Thanks to you, our technology has been recovered.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL0XMD|Even though we lost Yuri's spies, we know that he is going to commence a powerful assault on Germany and we don't have too much time left to prepare for the attack.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL10|The Black Forest lab has been saved, Einstein's work can continue.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL11|The Chronosphere is built. Thanks to your tireless effort, the Allies are ready for one final push to victory.
GUI:OVERPARMSGALL12|Romanov is captured, the war is won. Victory is yours.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV01|Thanks to you, the Pentagon has been destroyed and the American military has been thrown into chaos.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV01MD|PsiCorp forces didn't destroy 4-G but now they know that Moscov forces have survived.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV02|The American fleet was destroyed. While Soviet casualties were high, this is of no concern so long as you continue to bring victory.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV02MD|Though the Nuclear Silos have been destroyed and so are Demolition Trucks, PsiCorp could transport some of nuclear charges away and we are still in danger of atomic disaster.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV03|You have spread the power of Premier Romanov. American civilians are eagerly joining our army.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV03MD|This Psychic Amplifier has been neutralized, but we can have some problems with recapturing USSR in the future.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV04|In a long and bloody battle, you successfully defended mother Russia.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV04MD|Psychic Amplifier has been activated and we have now enough force to restart our warfare, but Yuri will surerly try to break the Great Wall of China.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV05|You turned the Paris Tower into a weapon of terror. You have 'punished' Europe sufficiently.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV05MD|The Centurion is now ready, but transport of it may cause some difficulties.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV06|The Koreans and Americans have been successfully divided. The Pacific is ours.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV06MD|Yuri surerly won't be interested in leaving Moscow so easily.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV07|The battle lab is safe. The Allies will not dare strike inside mother Russia again.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV07MD|TRANSMISSION INTERRUPTED
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV08|Vladimir has been punished for his crimes. Your victory has not gone unnoticed in this dark hour.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV08MD|The Mental Omega has been destroyed, Yuri has been found dead near the Kremlin, though he has been shot from close range with a simple revolver. Premier Romanov was found near him, unluckily dead too, probably killed by Yuri before his death. Anyway, hope this ends this great war.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV09|The President is ours to command. You will be rewarded for your zeal.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV0XMD|You managed to capture HQ and drive away Yuri's forces from China but there is a mysterious danger we have to be aware of..
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV10|The Allies cannot hold out much longer against your heavy-handed assaults. You use the lives of your men well.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV11|Yuri's defenses were weak and feeble. Your tank divisions swept him aside as you have swept aside so many others.
GUI:OVERPARMSGSOV12|The Allies are beaten and the world is begging to be spared the carnage of your armed forces. Supreme power is yours alone.

GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL01|Your lightning counterattack blunted the Soviet invasion.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL01MD|The Psychic Amplifier has been quickly destroyed, but the news from Russia aren't promising commander.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL02|Your tank blitz stunned the Soviets, ending the battle in a few short hours.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL02MD|Excellent work Commander. This will surerly stop PsiCorp from processing deeper into the Africa at least for a while.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL03|The President was rescued long before the Soviets could discover any important military secrets.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL03MD|PsiCorp seems not to be able to control the situation. They have already lost control in Africa, South America and North America thanks to your fast and effective operations.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL04|The tragic loss of Chicago, however devastating, doesn't compare to the loss of our whole nation. Your quick destruction of the Psychic Amplifier meant that the Soviets never had time to fully test its power.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL04MD|Thanks to your accuracy, Yuri's mutants will no longer frighten tourists nor Yuri himself will be able to avoid his ultimate lose with the Time Machine.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL05|Soviet commanders are still analyzing your attack, trying to discover the secrets of your advanced covert strategies.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL05MD|Yuri's assault has been stopped without many casualities and now, when Prof. Einstein has finished work on his Chrono Sphere, we can strike straight into Moscow!
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL06|The precision with which you destroyed the Soviet forces and liberated Washington DC is one for the record books.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL06MD|Yuri's forces in Moscow have been destroyed but it appears that Yuri is no longer Kremlin.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL07|You defended Pearl Harbor with such ferocity that the Pacific is ours.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL07MD|Soviet "b-side" plans have been crushed along with the device. Now, we must finally face Yuri as we located his last hideout.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL08|You saved Saint Louis before her citizens could come to any harm.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL08MD|Yuri's ominous plan has been ruined along destruction of his devilish weapon. The world will be safe for once and forever. At least from Yuri.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL09|Soviet Soldiers have nicknamed you "The Ghost" for your skills at stealthy destruction.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL0XMD|Even though we lost Yuri's spies, we know that he is going to commence a powerful assault on Germany. We are still able to prepare for the attack.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL10|Impressed by your efficiency, German Commanders have asked you to train their officers in strategy and command.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL11|Russian commanders fear your command more than whole Allied divisions. If one man can make a difference, you are that man.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGALL12|Your legendary command skills will go down in history. You are one of the greatest generals of all time.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV01|The Pentagon was crushed so quickly that many important American generals were captured by our victorious soldiers, crippling their armed forces.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV01MD|You have destroyed enemy force before PsiCorp could react. They don't know about our secret base yet, so we can prepare for the war.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV02|The American fleet and Naval base were destroyed so quickly that your soldiers were able to capture several American officers.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV02MD|Your sneak and fast sabotage operation succeed and we are sure that PsiCorp could not react early enough to take the nuclear charges away from Libya.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV03|The Psychic Beacon was built so quickly that an entire American Armored division was captured by its power before they could escape.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV03MD|The Psychic Amplifier has been destroyed and the Allies again believe we fought for a common good. Even bigger fools.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV04|The Korean invasion was repelled with such ferocity that some members of their government have spoken secretly to us of peace.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV04MD|China is ours and Yuri will now meet the force to be reckoned with.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV05|The French fear your command more than they fear our tanks. In Paris you are known only as 'The Butcher'.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV05MD|Yuri's Epsilon force has been eliminated quickly and soon we will move Centurion straight to Russia.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV06|Allied Admirals now refuse to send their ships to sea, so quick was your destruction of Pearl Harbor.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV06MD|You have moved Centurion and our assault forces so fast, that Yuri won't react so quickly when we appear in Moscow.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV07|Your ruthless efficiency has earned you great respect in the Red Army and made Soviet leadership fear your popularity.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV07MD|TRANSMISSION INTERRUPTED
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV08|Traitors beware: Your sudden and righteous attack on Washington D.C. has made your rivals fear your strategic skills.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV08MD|Mental Omega has been destroyed, Yuri has been found dead near the Kremlin, though he has been shot from close range with a simple revolver. Premier Romanov was found near him, unluckily dead too, probably killed by Yuri before his death. Anyway, hope this ends this great war.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV09|World leaders tremble in fear at the mention of our psychic troops. With you in command, no one is safe.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV0XMD|You managed to capture HQ and drive away Yuri's forces from China but there is a mysterious danger we have to be aware of..
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV10|Your strategic skills are becoming legendary. It is openly said among the men that it is you alone that will bring them victory.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV11|Already your name is known to school children as the greatest general the world has ever known.
GUI:UNDERPARMSGSOV12|History will name you among the greatest commanders that has ever lived. Now the world is yours to rule.

NAME:COOPDESC1|- Texas DMZ - \n It's Americans versus Soviets in the Southwestern United States. Players must push the Soviets and their Cuban allies out of the Texas plains. The campaign ends with the destruction of a Russian fortress just inside the Mexican border. Difficulty is EASY.
NAME:COOPDESC11|Our satelittes located another Yuri's leftover base in Egypt. Epsilon collapsed in chaos after lost of their master seems to started fighting on it's own. Further development of their technology may even allow them to reconstruct the Psychic Amplifier in the sand canyon - we cannot let that happen! Commander 1 will attack enemy from above using airbase we managed to deploy while Commander 2 will take majority in cliff protection.
NAME:COOPDESC12|Though Yuri managed to invent a Genetic Mutator Device shortly before his failure, Epsilon managed to take the plans of construction away, to an island located on the Pacific. Two devices with limited range have been established there and it looks like that those are only remaining mutators on the world. They must be destroyed and navy is only way to win. Both Commanders will call their fleet to siege the island.
NAME:COOPDESC13|You have successfully driven Yuri and his Russian allies back into the USSR. The time has come to finish them, Commanders. Establish your bases and end this war.
NAME:COOPDESC2|- European Theater - \n Knock on the Soviet's front door in Eastern Europe. Players choose between British, French and German Allies. The battle ends with an attack across the Russian border at a major Soviet outpost. Difficulty is EASY.
NAME:COOPDESC21|Though Yuri has been trapped in time, Epsilon forces are still active. Recently, they have captured two Nuclear Missile Silos in Vladivostok, but they haven't armed them yet. If we will move to the city and strike at Epsilon bases, our outposts there will be most probably a targets for missile tests. Commander 1 will lead ground attack with massive armored forces while Commander 2 will attack from water.
NAME:COOPDESC22|One of American bases in Mexico has been captured by Epsilon forces. They have started to develop genetic facilities and stealth technology there, probably to force an assault just after they will be able to rush the United States. Commander 1 will engage an air assault while Commander 2 will protect the bridge which is the only way to reach our bases.
NAME:COOPDESC23|We have located yet another outpost of Epsilon on Greenland. This one seems to be bit better protected though, we don't know yet why. Reason of such defense may be a huge spinning tower located near the shore, which must be destroyed before we even get to know how does it work. Both Commanders will have to construct their bases across the water zone which is the only way to reach shore.
NAME:COOPDESC3|- Guardians of the East - \n The Republic of Korea must thwart Soviet aggression in South East Asia. The campaign culminates with the Korean forces invading the snowy shoreline of eastern Russia. Difficulty is MODERATE.
NAME:COOPDESC31|Neither Allies nor Soviets know that we are preparing for final assault, though Epsilon forces are still under attack of their armies. One of our bases in Cuba is being attacked by their forces, we must protect it as I have further plans to do with that basement. Both of you will lead protection and assault at once.
NAME:COOPDESC32|Foolish Soviets after defeating me myself thought that they can decrease their protection as there is no more danger... That allowed us to attack from side of Alaska. We have deployed some forces there which are ready for your commands. Commander 1 will lead assault on the outposts from air while Commander 2 will eliminate enemy navy and siege base with Boomer Submarines.
NAME:COOPDESC33|While I will be investigating into USSR, you commanders will try to take over one of strategy Allied bases in Canada. It is heavy protected but I am sure that you will be able to turn it into scrap quickly. Commander 1 will use stealth technology for best advantage while Commander 2 will lead heavy armored assault.
NAME:COOPDESC4|- African Warlords - \n Seize the oil fields of North Africa. Players control Iraqi and Libyan factions, fighting European Allies. Difficulty is MODERATE.
NAME:COOPDESC41|In the wake of the Soviet invasion, Yuri has established two bases in the heart of New York City. No longer under Yuri's control, the Red Army has allied with the Americans to defeat the traitor.
NAME:COOPDESC5|- Red Storm - \n Players choose among the American and European Allies to fight the Russians in the North Sea and across Northern Europe. The campaign ends with a spectacular naval battle in the cold Baltic sea. Difficulty is HARD.

VOX:CEVAU01|Like our own Construction Vehicle, the Soviets can use this MCV to place base anywhere.
VOX:CEVAU02|The Soviet War Miner can easily hold off a small attack force. When hunting down the War Miner, send plenty of fire-power.
VOX:CEVAU03|Simple Soviet technology. The Rhino Heavy Tank is slow, heavily armored and fitted with a devestating short range cannon.
VOX:CEVAU04|The Soviet Terror Drone can easily penetrate the armor of our vehicles. Once inside a vehicle the Terror Drone will destroy it slowly from within. The only way to get a Terror Drone out of a vehicle is to move it to a Service Depot.
VOX:CEVAU05|The Flak Track is standard Soviet air defense. Like all Soviet technology, it is slow and well armored.
VOX:CEVAU06|The V3 is a powerful long-range artillery weapon. Beware commander, it can level your base in minutes without you ever getting a chance to even return fire.
VOX:CEVAU07|The most powerful Soviet Tank ever built, the Apocalpyse is a small army all by itself and is equipped to handle both ground and air threats.
VOX:CEVAU08|The most powerful air unit ever created, the Kirov can take a beating and drop an almost unlimitted number of heavy iron bombs.
VOX:CEVAU09|The Sea Scorpion makes an excellent raider and can also be used to escort heavy Soviet warships.
VOX:CEVAU10|The Soviets have somehow managed to pacify and control the Giant Squid found in the cold waters of the North Pacific. Beware commander, they can immobilize a ship and pull it under in a matter of minutes.
VOX:CEVAU11|The Soviets use their Typhoon Attack Sub to raid our shipping and make surprise attacks on our fleets.
VOX:CEVAU12|The Armored Transort is meant to carry a large number of troops across an ocean to our shores. It is often filled with Soviet troops and can be difficult to destroy.
VOX:CEVAU13|The ultimate in Soviet long-range bombardment, the Dreadnought is powerful from a distance but can be easily destroyed at close range. The Dreadnought's missiles can also be shot down by patriot missiles.
VOX:CEVAU14|The standard Soviet grunt, the Consript is poorly fed, poorly trained and poorly equipped for combat with your boys.
VOX:CEVAU15|The Soviets have taken Tesla Technology to the final step, a man in a Tesla powered suit. These soldiers are excellent at destroying tanks and also seem to be able to power up Tesla Coils with their extra energy.
VOX:CEVAU16|The Soviet Engineer is effective though he is more poorly trained than his American counter-part.
VOX:CEVAU17|Beware these Soviet Attack Dogs, they can quickly sniff out our spies and ruin all of our attempts at covert operations.
VOX:CEVAU18|This Soviet lunatic can and will place bombs on just about anything.
VOX:CEVAU19|This soldier is equiped with a nuclear battlesuit. He can irradiate large patches of ground, making them impassible to infantry or light vehicles.
VOX:CEVAU20|The Soviets have been experimenting with Psychic technology with some success. Their elite PsiCorps can cause our own loyal soldiers to turn against us.
VOX:CEVAU21|Sir, our GI is the finest example of standard infantry soldier in the world. Whether deployed or garrisoning a city building, the GI's heavy machine gun can quickly neutralize any enemy infantry threat.
VOX:CEVAU22|This, sir, is our IFV. It is a multipurpose raider capable of boosting the standard weapon capabilities of any infantryman inside.
VOX:CEVAU23|Sir, this is an engineer. He can repair any Allied building and once inside an enemy building turn it to our side. He is much smarter than his Soviet counterpart.
VOX:CEVAU24|Sir, the SEAL is the elite soldier. No enemy is safe from him, whether on land or water.
VOX:CEVAU25|Commander, the spy's ability to mask himself as the enemy and pass through their ranks gives him the needed edge to infiltrate even the most well guarded enemy building. If only they didn't taste so good to their dogs_
VOX:CEVAU26|The Rocketeers are the brave men who strap maneuvering thrusters to their backs and then go out to hunt enemy tanks and air forces. They are very brave.
VOX:CEVAU27|Commander, this is a Chrono Legionnaire. Using Professor Einstein's Chronal technology they teleport next to any enemy and utterly erase them from time.
VOX:CEVAU28|Sir, these superbly trained dolphins are equipped with special array that allows them to concentrate their natural sonar to easily locate enemy submerged vessels or further concentrate their sonar to attack.
VOX:CEVAU29|Although not as well armored as its Soviet counterpart, our Grizzly Battle tank is much faster and packs the same punch.
VOX:CEVAU30|Commander, our Prism Tank is based on the Prof. Einstein's light enhancement process. It is most effective in dealing with the massive force tactics that the Soviets prefer to use.
VOX:CEVAU31|Commander, our Mirage Tank's ability to hide itself among any natural objects around it make it the perfect ambush or covert surveillance vehicle.
VOX:CEVAU32|The Black Hawk helicopter utilizes the most advanced stealth technologies slip past enemy lines without detection on radar.
VOX:CEVAU33|Sir, the Intruder is a VTOL attack aircraft capable of delivery its ordinance on any target package you desire across the combat zone.
VOX:CEVAU34|Another marvel of technology from Professor Einstein's bag of tricks. Our Chrono Miners can teleport safely and quickly straight back home after gathering their ore supply.
VOX:CEVAU35|Commander, our landing craft is capable of quickly ferrying troops and armor across any body of water- wherever you need them- whenever you need them.
VOX:CEVAU36|Commander, our Destroyer is the workhorse of the navy. No naval unit can long hide from it and once detected, it makes short work of the enemy.
VOX:CEVAU37|Commander, there is no airborne threat that can evade the sight or missile of the Aegis Cruiser. It is the premier anti-air weapon.
VOX:CEVAU38|Sir, our Aircraft Carriers are the pride of the Allied navy. In a moments notice, the carrier's planes can take out any target quickly and from a very safe distance.

VOX:CSOFU01|The Soviet Construction Vehicle is essential and should be defended as such. You cannot create a Construction Yard without one.
VOX:CSOFU02|The Allied Chrono Miner may have the greater speed of teleportation but our War Miner is heavily armored and heavily armed making it immune to most harassment attacks.
VOX:CSOFU03|As the backbone of the Soviet assault force, the Rhino Heavy Tank should be used in all forward positions.
VOX:CSOFU04|Soviet technology at its finest. Terror Drones can enter and destroy enemy vehicles from the inside.
VOX:CSOFU05|The Flak Track is an effective anti-air defense unit, but its flak burst just as effective against ground targets if you don't mind the mess.
VOX:CSOFU06|The V3 Launcher has extreme range capabilities coupled with devastating damage potential. Destruction guaranteed just don't leave it undefended.
VOX:CSOFU07|The appropriately named Apocalypse Tank is war in a can. It can attack any ground or air targets and be expected to be the last unit standing.
VOX:CSOFU08|They may be slow, but the Kirov Airships can take great punishment and deliver even more.
VOX:CSOFU09|The Sea Scorpion is a fast-attack sea raider. It can't win the war for you but you can't win the war without it. It is your only anti-air defense on the water.
VOX:CSOFU10|I don't agree with this kind of experimentation, but you cannot deny the results. A Giant Squid can immobilize and eventually destroy any sea vessel.
VOX:CSOFU11|The Typhoon Attack Sub is undetectable by normal Allied units, but look out for Allied Dolphins and Destroyers.
VOX:CSOFU12|Unlike the Allied naval transport, our Armored Transport is well armed. It will get your men and units to the target.
VOX:CSOFU13|The Soviet Dreadnought can launch destructive missiles over great distances, but its fire rate is too slow for direct combat.
VOX:CSOFU14|Our Soviet Conscripts may not be as well trained as the Allied GI, but we have the advantage of greater numbers.
VOX:CSOFU15|The Tesla Troopers have powerful weapons, but they are useless against buildings. They also make excellent base defense as they can over-power Tesla Coils with their weapons.
VOX:CSOFU16|The Soviet Engineer can repair buildings or capture enemy buildings, if you can get them past defenses.
VOX:CSOFU17|Soviet attack dogs can smell out enemy Spies and deal with them quickly. Don't leave them out of your base defense teams.
VOX:CSOFU18|Crazy Ivan can plant bombs on enemy buildings or perhaps a Conscript would agree to carry them for you.
VOX:CSOFU19|The Allies cannot match our nuclear power. Deploy the Desolator to sterilize an area.
VOX:CSOFU20|Our most top-secret weapon, the PsiCorps is useful for quickly turning Allied units to our side.
VOX:CSOFU21|Commander, this Allied GI is a well trained soldier capable of quickly deploying a heavy machine gun when stationed within buildings or deployed with his sandbag nest.
VOX:CSOFU22|This_thing_is the allied IFV. Any soldier that climbs inside will find his primary weapon's capabilities boosted. As with most Allied vehicles it is very quick.
VOX:CSOFU23|Although similar to our own engineers in their ability to repair damaged buildings and bridges or even to steal another's building, the Allied engineers are nowhere near as well trained as our own engineers.
VOX:CSOFU24|Comrade, this SEAL is a threat to all of our forces. They must be watched for at all times, whether on land or even at sea.
VOX:CSOFU25|These arrogant Allied Spies believe their disguises will allow them to infiltrate our buildings. They will soon find that the only thing they can infiltrate is our faithful dogs' stomachs.
VOX:CSOFU26|The Allied Rocketeers are men who hurl themselves through the air thanks to some jet-pack strapped to them in the hopes of wounding one of our tanks or buildings. Fools.
VOX:CSOFU27|Commander, beware these Chrono Legionnaires. They use some unknown technology to teleport themselves anywhere and then simply erase our forces.
VOX:CSOFU28|These dolphin nuisances are quick. They can sense the passage of our submarines and find our Squids and their squeal can do some damage as well.
VOX:CSOFU29|Commander, the Allied Grizzly Tank is a smaller, quicker version of our own tanks, but its armor is not sufficient to stand up directly to our own.
VOX:CSOFU30|Comrade, this `Prism' Tank of the Allies is a dangerous threat to our massed forces. Its directed energy weapon has no trouble harming many of our forces in a single shot.
VOX:CSOFU31|Another annoying trick of the Allies, their Mirage Tank can mask itself a nearly any object nearby it and then remain concealed and fire upon us.
VOX:CSOFU32|Sir, the enemy's Black Hawk transport must always be watched for. It can not be seen by radar, so you must keep a watchful eye ready to stop it.
VOX:CSOFU33|The Allied Intruder is an airborne threat to any of our forces who do not have adequate anti-air support. It does not stand up well to flak, Commander.
VOX:CSOFU34|Yet another parlor trick from that nuisance Einstein. The Allied Chrono Miner gathers ore from the field and then teleports itself and its small yield back to its refinery.
VOX:CSOFU35|Compared to our own Armored Transport, this small transport is unimpressive. It delivers a small number of forces across the water.
VOX:CSOFU36|These Allied Destroyers are a problem. They can detect us underwater as well as on the surface and are equipped to deal sufficient damage to both.
VOX:CSOFU37|Commander, this is the Allies Aegis Cruiser. If you do not try to attack it from the air, then it will quickly be underwater and harmless.
VOX:CSOFU38|Commander, these Allied Aircraft Carriers are dangerous if left alone to bomb us from a distance but they are not very good for close combat against submerged combatants.
VOX:CSOFU39|Comrade, Tanya is a threat to all of our forces. They must be watched for at all times, whether on land or even at sea.

VOX:IYURSEC|I know your thoughts.
VOX:IYURSED|Your mind is clear.
VOX:IYURSEE|The mind is quicker than the eye.
VOX:MA1EV01|Don't forget, Sir! Order Tanya as you see fit, but we CANNOT afford to lose her. You must reach Fort Bradley before it is destroyed.
VOX:MA1EV02|Looks like the bridge has been blown. We'll have to find another way to Fort Bradley.
VOX:MA1EV03|The Soviet Navy is attacking the Statue of Liberty! We can't let them get away with that! Sir, is there anything you can do?
VOX:MA1EV04|Doesn't sound good, Sir! We're going to have to double-time it the rest the way to reach Fort Bradley in time!
VOX:MA1EV05|Congratulations! We've reestablished contact with Fort Bradley! They're turning over control of the base and its troops to you.
VOX:MA1EV06|We seem to have lost power, sir! Build more power plants.
VOX:MA1EV07|Looks like the bridge has collapsed. We'll have to get our Engineers to repair it!
VOX:MA1EV08|Watch out for those Petroleum barrels - They seem highly unstable! Perhaps we can use them to our advantage...
VOX:MA1EV09|Our GI's are too exposed to enemy fire! Maybe they should take shelter in nearby buildings!
VOX:MA1EV10|Sir, I'm sorry to report that we've lost Tanya_
VOX:MA1EV11|There's the Supply Base! Destroy all of the buildings, and we'll buy some time for the rest of the country!
VOX:MA1EV12|We've done it Sir! The Supply Base has been eliminated!
VOX:MA1EV13|You must hurry to reach Fort Bradley as quickly as possible!
VOX:MA1EV14|To earn more credits, command your Chrono Miners to gather ore.
VOX:MA1EV15|This vehicle is known as a Chrono Miner - it can be used to gather valuable minerals, and when fully loaded will teleport back to the Refinery docking bay.
VOX:MA1EV16|Additional Soviet forces are incoming, and will surely arrive soon!
VOX:MA1EV17|Soviet paratroopers detected.
VOX:MA1EV18|Commander, you must reach Fort Bradley as quick... wait... What are those Dreadnoughts doing? They're attacking the Statue of Liberty? You can't let this happen!
VOX:MA1EV19|Liberty is fallen, sir. This looks like the beginning of the end.
VOX:MA1EV20|Tanya has perished, sir. We can't do this without her!
VOX:MA1EV21|Sir, Fort Bradley just reported that the Soviets have managed to establish a small supply base just southeast of here. If we can eliminate the supply base, perhaps can stall the invasion for a short while!
VOX:MA1EV22|Deploy an occupied civilian structure to evacuate its occupants.
VOX:MA2TA01|All right! This beacon's neutralized! Send in the cavalry
VOX:MA3EV01|You have discovered Allied units abandoned after the Soviet invasion.
VOX:MA3EV02|The Psychic Beacon must be destroyed, Commander!
VOX:MA3EV03|Watch out for Soviet troops garrisoned in civilian structures throughout the city!
VOX:MA4EV01|Objective 1: Use your paradrop squad to take out the Soviet Tesla Reactors, shutting down their harbor defenses.
VOX:MA4EV02|Objective 2:
VOX:MA4EV03|Seek out the Soviets' Tesla Reactors and take them out with your Destroyers, crippling their air defenses.
VOX:MA4EV04|Perhaps we should send our Destroyers scouting up the Chicago River, they may reveal key installations in the Soviet base.
VOX:MA5EV01|You can check one missile off your list, Sir! That bird will never fly again.
VOX:MA5EV02|Sir, we managed to capture one of the Silos - instead of destroying it! Why don't we just turn it against the other missile Silo?
VOX:MA5EV03|If you can get a Spy into one of those Tesla Generators, he can probably shut down all of the base's power for a good 30 seconds.
VOX:MA5EV04|I'm resizing your radar to compensate for the Nuclear missile coordinates that we just received. Stand by.
VOX:MA5EV05|Sir! You just blew up the Soviet Battlelab! Without the Missile Silo coordinates, we can't complete our mission!
VOX:MA5EV06|Congratulations, Sir! With both nukes neutralized, the European Alliance can join the war! We may have just changed the course of history!
VOX:MA5EV07|If you can get a Spy into one of those Tesla Generators, he can probably shut down all of the base's power for a good 60 seconds.
VOX:MA5EV08|Sir, Tanya is missing in action. Without her, our efforts here are in vain.
VOX:MA5I101|Thanks for rescuing us, Sir! Our plane was shot down by Soviet anti-aircraft. There's probably more survivors around here.
VOX:MA5I201|Glad you found us, Sir! We're freezing out here!
VOX:MA5I301|Good to see you, Sir! What are our orders?
VOX:MA5I401|Be on the lookout for spies, Comrade. It seems a little quiet tonight.
VOX:MA5I501|(Laugh) We don't need to worry about stupid American spies. That's what the dogs are for.
VOX:MA5TA01|Looks like we're going to need some more Spies, Sir!
VOX:MA5TA02|Sir, could you send some more Spies without neon camouflage this time?
VOX:MA5TA03|Looks like Spies are becoming an Endangered Species. Send some more!
VOX:MA5TA04|(Tanya swears several times and is 'beeped' out) Sorry, Sir, but we need some more Spies.
VOX:MA6EV01|Hey! That's not Lincoln. They've put a Stalin head on him!
VOX:MA6EV02|Sir, several of our vehicles have been eaten by Terror Drones. Our Service Depot can remove the drones and save our vehicles.
VOX:MA7EV01|Commander, Niihau Island has fallen. We should prepare the rest of Hawaii for invasion.
VOX:MA7EV02|Commander, the Soviets have finished construction of a nuclear missile launcher on Niihau. We must build Gap Generators to hide our base before they can launch.
VOX:MA8IA01|Can't concentrate voices in my head_ _victory to the Soviet Union.
VOX:MA8IA02|victory to the Sov we're free! Get'em!
VOX:MA8TA01|Must reach the beacon just a little bit farther long live the glorious peoples Soviet state.
VOX:MA9SE01|We're going to need some help getting through those defenses.
VOX:MA9SE02|Hot Tamale! That's no Mayan Pyramid_ that's a Prism Cannon.
VOX:MA9SE03|Sir, these freedom fighters want to join up.
VOX:MAAEI01|What does this button do?
VOX:MAAEI02|Commander! Look out! They are over here.
VOX:MAAEI03|Get these commander! Here they are! Here!
VOX:MAAEI04|You should see this Commander!
VOX:MAAEV01|Please don't touch the auxiliary controls professor. They notify the commander of important events.
VOX:MAAEV02|Professor please stay off this channel.
VOX:MAAEV03|Professor Einstein! I'm sure the Commander sees that.
VOX:MAAEV04|Professor if you touch the controls again_
VOX:MAAEV05|Sir, if you build and deploy a spy satellite you will be able to see the entire combat area.
VOX:MAAEV06|We're rather low on resources in this location, sir. Perhaps you should construct an Ore Purifier so we can get more out of what we have.
VOX:MABEV01|Commander, Marine World has loaned us their trained dolphins. They can be use a sonic enhancer to attack the Squids and drive them off our ships.
VOX:MACEV01|Attemping to jam Soviet Command's calls for help, but a few got through. Heavier Soviet reinforcements arriving soon.
VOX:MACEV02|Teleporting troops arriving in 5_ 4_ 3_ 2_ 1.
VOX:MACEV03|Intercepting broadcast from Soviet Command. Romanov's panicking, sir. He's called for air evacuation. The transports will arrive in 2 minutes.
VOX:MACEV04|Soviet evacuation transports arriving in 1 minute.
VOX:MACEV05|Soviet evacuation transports arriving in 30 seconds.
VOX:MACEV06|Sir, Romanov is calling for evacuation again. He is trying to escape.
VOX:MACEV07|Psionic Amplifier captured. Soviet units are defecting to our side.
VOX:MACEV08|Psionic Amplifier destroyed.
VOX:MACEV09|Romanov captured.
VOX:MACEV10|Teleporting troops arriving in 5_
VOX:MACEV11|Chrono Reinforcements have arrived.
VOX:MACEV12|Commander, the time to act is now. The bulk of our armies stand ready to be transported to this very location, but first Tanya must clear the way for them by eliminating the Psychic Amplifier.
VOX:MACEV13|Tanya has failed, sir. Our best efforts have been all for naught.
VOX:MACEV14|Sir, the Psychic Amplifier has been destroyed, and Soviet forces have begun to defect to our side!
VOX:MACEV15|Our objective now is simple: Tanya must capture Romanov from his hiding place - the Kremlin.
VOX:MACEV16|To capture Romanov, Tanya must enter the Kremlin.
VOX:MACEV17|The Soviet High Command has been alerted to our presence. Prepare for a Soviet counter attack.
VOX:MACEV18|With Romanov captured and being interrogated as we speak, it seems the Soviet menace has come to an end.
VOX:MACIS01|We will never surrender! Death to the Allies!
VOX:MACTA01|We can't let Romanov get away!
VOX:MACVE01|I'm going to be sick.
VOX:MACVE02|Where are we?
VOX:MACVE03|Is this Russia?
VOX:MS1SO01|Commander, this is the first step in our glorious conquest. Victory here is crucial! Remember, we must crush the Pentagon - above all else, the Pentagon must be destroyed!
VOX:MS1SO02|We can't let a mere bridge delay our conquest, commander! Order your Engineers to enter the bridge's control station!
VOX:MS1SO03|Commander, pay no heed to casualties. For every Conscript who dies in the crusade, there are a thousand more who stand eager to replace him!
VOX:MS1SO04|Commander, you can order your Conscripts into nearby buildings to fortify them against the enemy.
VOX:MS1SO05|At last, the Pentagon is within our grasp! Destroy it, immediately.
VOX:MS1SO06|Ah... Our Comrades have decided to lend us support. These reinforcement Commander, are some of our most useful vehicles _ Flak Tracks! Their speed armor, and ability to carry infantry are the perfect support for our legion of Conscripts
VOX:MS1SO07|Superb, Commander! The Pentagon has been destroyed!
VOX:MS1SO09|Our base is out of power! We must build more generators to bring our radar and defenses back online!
VOX:MS1SO10|Be wary of those barrels of petrol! If damaged, they will surely explode violently. Perhaps we can use them to our advantage...
VOX:MS1SO11|Capture the airport commander in order to allow paratroopers to land in the area.
VOX:MS1SO12|Excellent, Comrade Commander! As soon as the Paratroopers are completely prepared, we will be able to strike anywhere you desire!
VOX:MS1SO13|The building that you've just discovered is one of America's special civilian buildings. Use an Engineer to convert the building and gain its powers.
VOX:MS1SO14|Deploy an occupied civilian structure to remove its occupants.
VOX:MS1SO15|This useful vehicle is known as a War Miner - it can be used to gather valuable minerals, and will defend itself with a turret-mounted cannon.
VOX:MS1SO16|To earn more credits, command your War Miners to gather ore.
VOX:MS1SO17|Iron Curtained units detected.
VOX:MS1SO18|Incoming Kirovs detected.
VOX:MS1SO19|You must destroy the Kremlin, where Yuri is cowering.
VOX:MS3CA04|(droned) By your command, Comrade.
VOX:MS3CA05|(droned) Death to the capitalists!
VOX:MS3CA06|(droned) Glory to Mother Russia!
VOX:MS3CA07|I will obey the Soviet ooh! where am I?
VOX:MS3IA01|Yes master
VOX:MS3SO01|Welcome to New York, Commander. Capture the Allied Battle Lab at the World Trade Center and use their technology to build the PSYCHIC BEACON
VOX:MS3SO02|The beacon is placed, Commander, but it needs time to charge. Keep theAllies from destroying the beacon.
VOX:MS3SO03|Beacon deployed and online.
VOX:MS3SO04|Excellent, Commander. Now use our new _conscripts_ to deal with theremaining Allied forces.
VOX:MS3SO05|Commander, capture these OIL DERRICKS for extra resources.
VOX:MS3SO06|Conscripts are more effective when garrisoned inside civilian buildings, Commander.
VOX:MS4SO01|Allied fleet has arrived.
VOX:MS4SO02|I have displayed the estimated time remaining until the Allied fleet arrives, Commander.
VOX:MS4SO03|The Allied air forces are threatening our position. Deploy our flak cannon and they will turn the enemy's air units into scrap metal.
VOX:MS5SO01|Commander, there is an AIRPORT somewhere nearby. Capture it and you will be able to airdrop Conscripts.
VOX:MS5SO02|Look for reinforcements stationed throughout the city, Commander.
VOX:MS5SO03|Be careful, Commander, once you reach the Paris Tower the Allied forces are like to rush your position.
VOX:MS5TE01|Get me close to the tower and I'll take care of the rest commander.
VOX:MS6SO01|A small reinforcement fleet of new Soviet Dreadnoughts has arrived. Use them for long range shore bombardment.
VOX:MS7SO01|Sources have reported that Allied troops are amassing outside their Chronosphere. A squad has just been teleported.
VOX:MS7SO02|Another enemy platoon has been teleported by the Chronosphere.
VOX:MS7SO03|One last Allied platoon has been teleported by the Chronosphere.
VOX:MS8SO01|Now that the beacon is destroyed, the Americans are free from Vladimir's mind control!
VOX:MS8SO02|Destroy monuments to receive a cash bonus from Moscow.
VOX:MS9PR01|Get me outta here!
VOX:MS9PR02|You Soviet scum, you'll never take me!
VOX:MS9PR03|They're breaking in! Do something!
VOX:MS9PR04|You don't want the Vice President running the country, do you!?
VOX:MS9PR05|<death>
VOX:MS9SE01|Get the President out of here! Go go go!
VOX:MS9SO01|Intelligence reports that there is another bridge south of your position.
VOX:MS9SO02|Yuri is in route to your position. Clear out the enemy defenses for his arrival.
VOX:MS9SO03|Careful not to destroy the bunker, Commander. We want the President alive for interrogation.
VOX:MS9SO04|The President is on the rescue ship. Sink the ship and we'll fish him from the water.
VOX:MS9YU01|Perhaps he needs some gentle persuasion.
VOX:MSASO01|Greetings, Commander. Your forces need to invade the Allied base and take over their Battle Lab. Get an Engineer in there so we can pin-point the location of their Super Weapon.
VOX:MSASO02|When your men are ready, I suggest you begin your assault here, Commander.
VOX:MSASO03|This beach is well defended, but it is also the only place to land troops effectively. Good luck, Sir.
VOX:MSASO04|Ah-ha, there it is! A Weather Control Device. Luckily Intel says that it couldn't possibly be operational yet. Take it out, Commander.
VOX:MSASO05|Apparently our intelligence was wrong. Apologies, Commander. I'm now downloading schematics for a Nuclear Missile Silo so you can deal with this new threat.
VOX:MSAYU01|Perhaps I could be of assistance.
VOX:MSBSO01|Yuri will destroy us all. He must be stopped, no matter what the cost.
VOX:MSBSO02|(commenting on Yuri's invulnerable Iron Curtained soldiers) Commander, Yuri must be using an Iron Curtain device to make his troops invulnerable to attack! Intel indicates that the Iron Curtain effect can't possibly be maintained for long.
VOX:MSBSO05|Commander, looks like our Nuclear Silo has been noticed... Yuri's sending bunch of Kirovs our way!
VOX:MSBSO06|We'd better get some Flak Cannons in place.
VOX:MSBYU01|You don't really think that War Factory will help you defeat me, do you?
VOX:MSBYU02|So you're building a Kirov I'm impressed.
VOX:MSBYU03|I wouldn't build that Psychic Sensor if I were you.
VOX:MSBYU04|You're not really planning to nuke mother Russia, are you?
VOX:MSBYU05|Terror Drones are such mindless beasts. Why don't you train an Engineer instead?
VOX:MSCSO03|Now move up the coast. There is a small airfield there where we can build a base and reclaim our captured Kirov airships.
VOX:MSCSO04|They are using the Chronosphere to transport troops into our base! We cannot stop this assault. Attack soon, Commander, or we will be overrun!
VOX:MT1DS01|Good morning commander and welcome to basic training. There's a war on so we have to make this a crash course. In front of you is your battlefield control interface. With this interface you can command any soldier on the field. Let's begin with the new recruit you see in the center of your screen. Move him away from his barracks and out into the field. Left click on the soldier to select him. Then left click on empty ground to move him to that location. Try not to get him killed on the way to the shooting range.
VOX:MT1DS02|Notice how you can order your soldier to move into the dark area surrounding the base. This shroud indicates areas of the terrain that you have not yet explored.
VOX:MT1DS03|Now that you've mastered the difficult task (said sarcastically) of commanding a single soldier, try ordering around a squad. First, select all of the men by left clicking and holding down the mouse button. In this mode you can drag a selection box around all of your men. Select all of the soldiers at once and order them north to the bridge.
VOX:MT1DS04|This bridge was destroyed yesterday when the Navy SEALs used it for demolition practice. An engineer is en-route to repair it. When he arrives, left click on him to select him then left click on the repair hut next to the bridge. Once the bridge is repaired, move your men across.
VOX:MT1DS05|This is the shooting range. Select your men by drag-selecting a box around the group. Once selected, left click on the targets down range. This will order your men to fire at these targets. Destroy all of the targets.
VOX:MT1DS06|Excellent, your men are good shots. There is a row of targets just out of range of your GIs. Double click on one of your men. He will set himself up in a small defensive position. In this mode he can fire at a greater range. Many units have special abilities like this. Now, order him to destroy the remaining targets.
VOX:MT1DS07|Notice that one of your men has a special symbol on him when he is selected. This unit is a veteran unit. Veterans are tougher, stronger and can fire more accurately than ordinary soldiers. Double click on the man who is set up in a defense position to order him to move-out. Now order your men to move on down the road.
VOX:MT1DS08|In front of you is a derelict American Grizzly Battle Tank. Order your men to destroy the crippled tank.
VOX:MT1DS09|It takes your men longer to destroy the tank than the targets at the rifle range. Regular soldiers are not efficient at destroying armored units. In turn, armored units may not be the most effective weapons for destroying dug in infantry. Pick the right unit when facing enemies. Good job today, you have completed an important part of your training.
VOX:MT1DS10|Hurry up commander, you're boring me.
VOX:MT1DS11|Keep it moving commander, your training has to go quickly, the Reds are already landing on our shores.
VOX:MT1DS12|Commander, this is only one soldier. In a few days you will have to command armies. Now left click on him and then left click on open ground to get him moving out of the base.
VOX:MT2DS01|Today you will fight a mock battle against another commander. He will command the red team, you will command of the blue team. Select your Mobil Construction Vehicle by left clicking on it and order it to move out of the base. Get it a safe distance away and try to find some open ground.
VOX:MT2DS02|Your Mobile Construction Vehicle is now in open ground. Double click on it to deploy a Construction Yard.
VOX:MT2DS03|Now that you have a Construction Yard you can begin to build a base. On the right hand side of your screen you can see that the icon for a Power Plant has appeared. Left click on that icon to start construction of the power plant. Notice how your remaining money decreases while the Power Plant is building. Each building has a cost to construct. When the Power Plant is done building, left click on it's image and then left click on an empty area near your Construction Yard. If you see red squares where you are trying to place the power plant then you are either trying to place the Power Plant too far away from your Construction Yard or you are trying to build on uneven ground.
VOX:MT2DS04|Good, your base now has power and you are ready to build more structures. Each buiding you construct also has a power cost. If you run short of power for all of your buildings, some will stop working, and others will work inefficiently. Left click on the Ore Refinery Icon on the right hand side of your screen to build a refinery.
VOX:MT2DS05|Now that you have placed a Power Plant you can build a barracks. Many buildings and units depend on one another. You cannot build a barracks until you have built a Power Plant. You cannot train soldiers until you have a barracks. Left click on the barracks to start its construction. When it is finished place it on the terrain just like you did with the Refinery and Power Plant.
VOX:MT2DS06|On the right hand side of your screen you should see a button that looks like a soldier. When you press that button you will see the different types of soldiers that you can train. Right now all you can train is a GI. Left click on the GI to start training him. Left click multiple times to train a series of GIs.
VOX:MT2DS07|Red team may attack soon. Your GIs are armed with rubber bullets for this mission. In real combat they would of course be shooting real bullets.
VOX:MT2DS08|Here comes red team, make me proud commander.
VOX:MT2DS09|Red team's strike force has been defeated. Now build some more soldiers commander and when you feel you are ready, move them out onto the map. Find Red team's Command Center and destroy it.
VOX:MT2DS10|You really weren't ready for red team were you commander? If this had happened against the Soviets, your base would now be in flames. Red team will pull back to give you a chance to build some more troops.
VOX:MT2DS11|Good job commander, you have defeated the red team. Your basic training complete.
VOX:MT2DS12|Your new Chrono Miner will automatically begin to collect ore.
VOX:MT2DS13|WARNING: The Red Team invasion imminent.
VOX:MT2DS14|Deploy your GIs near the entrance to your base for a better defense.
VOX:MT2DS15|Send your troops to garrison inside the barn for better protection from enemy fire.
VOX:MT2DS16|Send your troops to garrison inside civilian structures for better protection from enemy fire.
VOX:MT2DS17|Now is not the time for potty breaks, Commander.
VOX:MT2DS18|No time to sit, Commander.
VOX:MT2DS19|WARNING: The stench of Red Team is in the air.
VOX:MT2DS20|Now that you'e mastered the difficult task (said sarcastically) of commanding a single soldier, try ordering around a squad. First, select all of the men by left clicking and holding down the mouse button. In this mode you can drag a selection box around all of your men. Select all of the soldiers at once and order them East to the bridge.
VOX:MT2DS21|Notice that one of your men has a special symbol on him when he is selected. This unit is a veteran unit. Veterans are tougher, stronger and can fire more accurately than ordinary soldiers. Double click on the man who is set up in a defense position to order him to move-out. Now order your men to move on up the road.
VOX:TAUAM01|Gosh darn it, I need more cash!
VOX:TAUAM02|Yippy-kai-aye, I'm going in!
VOX:TAUAM03|Anytime you want to get into the fight, just jump on in.
VOX:TAUAM04|Try to distract him, I've got a plan.
VOX:TAUAM05|If you give up now, I promise amnesty for you and your men.
VOX:TAUAM06|Hahahaha.
VOX:TAUAM07|That was a cowards tactic.
VOX:TAUAM08|It's too late to surrender now.
VOX:TAUBR01|I am running a little low of cash.
VOX:TAUBR02|Attention, I am about to attack.
VOX:TAUBR03|Your help would be greatly appreciated.
VOX:TAUBR04|Try to get the enemies attention, me and the lads are going to try something.
VOX:TAUBR05|Perhaps you should surrender, and avoid further bloodshed.
VOX:TAUBR06|Hahahaha.
VOX:TAUBR07|That was hardly fair, now was it?
VOX:TAUBR08|Heads up old boy, here I come.
VOX:TAUCU01|How can I fight without money?
VOX:TAUCU02|I attack, now!
VOX:TAUCU03|Help me you fool.
VOX:TAUCU04|If you would do something, I might do something.
VOX:TAUCU05|Surrender!
VOX:TAUCU06|Hahahaha.
VOX:TAUCU07|You cheap, sniveling little coward!
VOX:TAUCU08|As if there was ever any doubt.
VOX:TAUFR01|I have run out of money.
VOX:TAUFR02|I think I may actually attack.
VOX:TAUFR03|I'm getting slaughtered, I will have to surrender in moments.
VOX:TAUFR04|Distract our enemy and I may try something.
VOX:TAUFR05|Surrender! No, I don't mean I surrender. I mean you surrender.
VOX:TAUFR06|Hahahaha.
VOX:TAUFR07|Even a trained monkey could execute that maneuver.
VOX:TAUFR08|Are you ready for me to crush you like the bug that you are?
VOX:TAUGE01|I need money immediately.
VOX:TAUGE02|The time to attack is now.
VOX:TAUGE03|Send help or you will soon be on your own.
VOX:TAUGE04|Distract him, I have something _clever_ in mind.
VOX:TAUGE05|Surrender, you are all but beaten.
VOX:TAUGE06|Hahahaha.
VOX:TAUGE07|I will get you for that.
VOX:TAUGE08|Ah, victory.
VOX:TAUIR01|As unbelievable as it may seem, I am out of money.
VOX:TAUIR02|I am about to attack.
VOX:TAUIR03|You must send help, don't ask questions, just do as you are told.
VOX:TAUIR04|If you distract our enemy, I will execute my master plan.
VOX:TAUIR05|It will be very boring for me, but perhaps you should surrender.
VOX:TAUIR06|Hahahaha.
VOX:TAUIR07|I will make you pay for that.
VOX:TAUIR08|Is not my army beautiful? Behold as it destroys everything you own.
VOX:TAUKO01|My resources are exhausted.
VOX:TAUKO02|My men are ready, soon we will attack.
VOX:TAUKO03|My soldiers are being slaughtered, send help.
VOX:TAUKO04|Distract our enemy commander and I will destroy him.
VOX:TAUKO05|Surrender now and you will live.
VOX:TAUKO06|Hahahaha.
VOX:TAUKO07|That was without honor.
VOX:TAUKO08|You are doomed.
VOX:TAULI01|I seem to be low on money.
VOX:TAULI02|The order is given: Attack!
VOX:TAULI03|Your assistance is required.
VOX:TAULI04|You must distract our enemies while I make a secret attack.
VOX:TAULI05|You are beaten! Surrender while you yet have buildings to sell!
VOX:TAULI06|Hahahaha.
VOX:TAULI07|What was that? You call that a tactic? You disgust me.
VOX:TAULI08|Look at the battle, your doom is at hand.
VOX:TAURU01|My resources are taxed to their limits.
VOX:TAURU02|I will soon crush our enemies.
VOX:TAURU03|Send me help comrade, before it is too late!
VOX:TAURU04|Do something you idiot. I have a plan.
VOX:TAURU05|If you surrender now, perhaps I will kill you quickly.
VOX:TAURU06|Hahahaha.
VOX:TAURU07|You are fool to try such tactics.
VOX:TAURU08|There is no escape, there will be no mercy.
VOX:UINST01|Warning: Military Soft-Ware Detected, top-secret Clearance Required!
VOX:UINST02|Encryption code required. You have 30 seconds to comply.
VOX:UINST03|Security Clearance complete. Customize combat software Commander.
VOX:UINST04|Combat Software fully customized, proceed to military intelligence emergency briefing.
VOX:UINST05|In 1946 this man, Albert Einstein used this device to go back in time and forever alter history.
VOX:UINST06|This changed caused Jospeh Stalin to lead communist Russia in a major invasion of Europe.
VOX:UINST07|At first the Soviet invasion was successful, and soon it appeared that the British would be the last free people in Europe.
VOX:UINST08|But the European Allies rallied, and pushed back the Red menace finally smashing the communist war machine.
VOX:UINST09|After Stalin's disappearance this man, Alexandre Romanov, came to power with the blessing of Allied commanders.
VOX:UINST10|Romanov came from old aristocracy and though a member of the communist party, he was an advocate of peace.
VOX:UINST11|Current satellite intelligence indicates that Romanov may not be acting in good faith.
VOX:UINST12|Soviet warships have been spotted moving at high speed into the Atlantic.
VOX:UINST13|This man, known only as _Yuri_ may be responsible for shutting down our entire covert intelligence network in the Soviet Union.
VOX:UINST14|We have received almost no intelligence data from the Soviet Union in 6 months. Our agents are all missing or have been seen working with KGB operatives.
VOX:UINST15|All of this data can only mean one thing commander. Invasion.
VOX:UINST16|The following are technical specs on current battlefield weapon systems. Observe carefully commander, you may have to command these units in combat.
