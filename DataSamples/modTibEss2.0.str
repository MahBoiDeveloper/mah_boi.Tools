"Disk Throwers are trained to quickly clear out enemy-occupied buildings through the use of lightweight, aerodynamic, discus-shaped grenades. Supplemented with bionic-assisted arms which allow these high-tech grenadiers to reach offensive ranges greater than those of traditional hand grenades, Disk Throwers are designed to destroy targets in fortified positions, including threats on the uppermost floors of tall buildings. The disk grenade is equipped with an onboard ballistics computer which calculates the distance to the target and spins in a given direction as the grenade travels along its flight path, making adjustments in speed and trajectory until impact. The ballistics computer can be preset to have the grenade airburst at a given distance and altitude to increase their effectiveness against fortified positions and minimize collateral damage in urban engagements. Secondly, the grenade can bounce across the ground if it does not initially strike its target, increasing its maximum range, but also increasing the possibility of collateral damage from ‘wild’ disks. In this regard, care must be exercised when deploying Disk Thrower squads into populated combat zones."

"Nod aircraft have been revolutionized considerably since the Second Tiberium War. In addition to the Banshee, Nod has since fielded the Venom VTOL, Vertigo Bomber, Carryall, and Armageddon Bomber. \n  Venoms are vertical-takeoff-and-landing scouting craft which operate similarly to Orcas. They are lightly armed and armored, but can be equipped with versatile loadouts to engage multiple threats, including Orcas. \n Vertigo Bombers are batwing-shaped stealth bombers armed with high-explosive bombs and equipped with a tail gun for aerial defense. Their stealth systems can evade detection by defensive sensors only until they move right on top of the detection equipment. During payload delivery, the Vertigo’s cloaking system is neutralized for a few seconds, allowing the Vertigo to be engaged by antiaircraft systems. \n  Carryalls are similar in shape, appearance, and purpose to the Orca Carryalls deployed by GDI during the Second Tiberium War. The counterpart to the V-35 Ox Transport, Carryalls service the purpose of transporting Nod troops and vehicles to any location on the battlefield. \n The Armageddon Bomber is a multirole, high-altitude, long-range support aircraft which acts as an ordnance delivery aircraft and a reconnaissance scout. Armageddon Bombers have been observed airdropping landmines, scouting terrain, and delivering troops and equipment to Nod positions. \n Since the Second Tiberium War, little has changed in terms of the Nod Banshee. It continually maintains its crescent moon-shaped airframe, as well as superior capabilities in speed and maneuverability. The Banshee is heavily armored and armed with two plasma cannons capable of burning through the thickest of armor plating, even the armor on the Mammoth Mk. II. Intelligence has also confirmed that with upgraded avionics packages, the Banshee can dogfight with enemy aircraft."

"Since the First Tiberium War, GDI has been renowned for its dominance of the battlefield through the deployment of high-tech and sophisticated armored vehicles, from the M1A1 Abrams Tank of yesteryear to the mechanized walkers of today. Reluctantly, treaded and wheeled vehicles have been all but phased out from GDI’s arsenal (with some notable exceptions) due to the drastic deformation of the earth’s terrain, of which Tiberium-infested environments have become the modern battlefields. In the Second Tiberium War, GDI activated its Battle Mechanized Walker Program, deploying a number of armored all-terrain walking vehicles, most notably the Wolverine, Titan, Mammoth Mk. II, and Juggernaut. \n When compared to wheeled and treaded vehicles, walking mechanized systems offer a number of advantages. The increased height of the walkers (especially the Titan and Mammoth Mk. II) allows them to scan further into the distance to detect targets. Mechanized walkers can also field greater levels of armor plating and high-powered weaponry without significantly impacting speed or performance, the elevated height of the weaponry allows for an extension of its effective and maximum range, their ability to maneuver quickly in difficult terrain surpasses that of their treaded ancestors, and the angle at which their ordnance is discharged allows them to strike the most vulnerable and weakest armored point on an enemy vehicle: its rooftop. \n The superior fighting capabilities of the mechanized walkers, especially the Titan and Mammoth Mk. II, are thought to have played a significant role leading to GDI’s total victory at the end of the second war. \n There are drawbacks to the use of mechanized walkers in combat, however. Most notably, their increased height allows enemy forces to easily spot oncoming walkers from great distances, and damage to the leg mechanisms can immobilize a walker, leaving it vulnerable to sustained attacks. Since the Second Tiberium War concluded, measures have been taken to increase the amount of armor protection fielded on the walkers, and all Titans have been configured for the installation of rail guns. These upgrades have preserved the fighting capabilities of all weapons fielded under the Battle Mechanized Walker Program. \n  However, the demilitarization of GDI following the end of the second conflict’s hostilities brought about the deactivated of the Battle Mechanized Walker Program in an effort to retain additional funding for further high-tech research. Afterwards, many mechanized walker crews were reassigned to crews of GDI’s newer ground-based vehicles. With Nod broken in several splintered factions and fanatical cells, the Brotherhood resumed its time-honored tactics of executing urban bombings and attacks on GDI-sympathetic civilian habitats. This prompted the institution of GDI rapid response policies to counter Nod terrorist activity. Most of the time, Nod terrorist attacks were executed in densely populated areas with little room to maneuver or space for colossal Dropships to deploy the mechanized walkers, which would have presented nightmarish conditions for Titans. This justified the fielding of treaded and wheeled vehicles which could be airlifted at a moment’s notice as a means of maintaining security in cities where Nod activity was frequent and devastating. Though Hover MLRS vehicles possessed the speed necessary for quick response counterattacks, their vulnerability to ion storms forced them into an artillery support role. \n At this stage, the Predator Tank was introduced. The Predator Tank offered to GDI a fast and maneuverable ground weapon which could inflict great damage upon armored Nod targets. However, the Predator Tank’s initial version was plagued by design flaws. The treads on the track shoes were almost completely exposed due to weight reduction concerns and a lack of track guards, the tank lacked a coaxial-mounted machine gun and a tank commander’s gun, plans to install a TOW Missile Launcher were discarded, and the engine was downgraded out of concern for weight reduction, which resulted in a loss of maximum speed. Veteran Predator crews known as Warhounds have attempted to address these drawbacks by custom-installing 20mm M61 Vulcan Cannons to their turret rooftops, but further Predator Tank production was halted upon the installment of ion atmospheric interference guards on all Hover MLRS. \n Despite the Predator Tank and mechanized walkers having ceased mainstream production, their design plans are still available for assembly at GDI War Factories should battle conditions necessitate their deployment. Secondly, Warhound crews stand ready for immediate deployment into combat to honor GDI’s traditions of armored battlefield dominance."

"GDI Intelligence has confirmed that individual Nod cells are coming into possession of Devil’s Tongue Flame Tanks. However, we have confirmed that several changes have been made to the weapon. While the tank’s principle as an anti-infantry platform remains constant, additional armor plating has been installed to the vehicle. Secondly, the flame cannons are no longer mounted to the side. Instead, they are positioned at the front and base of the tank and supplied by fuel tanks mounted directly inside the vehicle. Intelligence has noticed, however, that initial models of the Devil’s Tongue are missing their duel roller drills, which enable them to burrow underground to launch subterranean attacks, and we have confirmed that such upgrades are reserved for veteran Devil’s Tongue crews as per by authorization of the local Nod cell commander. \n Nevertheless, the weaknesses of the Devil’s Tongue are also apparent: a lack of armor and limited range. All commanders are advised to uphold traditional antitank tactics when encountering Devil’s Tongues: fire first, fire fast, fire accurately."

"According to sources inside the Global Defense Initiative, GDI’s Security Council has voted to discontinue funding for the Battle Mechanized Walker Program. This severance of funds has resulted in the discontinued production of several mechanized walker weapons platforms fielded by GDI, including the Wolverine, Titan, and most notably the Mammoth Mark II. \n The decision by the Security Council was met with praise by council members hoping to divert renewed funds to other costly high-tech projects, but protest by several GDI veterans and officers. Among the critics was Colonel Nicholas “Havoc” Parker, a commando and Special Operations commander, as well as an outspoken critic of recent changes agreed upon by Security Council members. \n “The suits behind their desks have again decided what the soldiers on the front line get to use,” Parker said. “Back in the old days, it was ‘Get the job done, Havoc, no matter what it takes,’ and nobody complained whenever their EVA units screamed out ‘Mission Accomplished’ afterwards. Now that we have the best toys on the planet and just won the [Second Tiberium] war with them, our mamas and papas on Sec-Count say we can’t play with them anymore because it costs too damn much to pay for them!” \n With rumors abound of walking Nod heavy mechanized weapons, Colonel Parkers hopes that the GDI Security Council will reconsider its decision to revoke the Battle Mechanized Walker Program’s continuality. \n “Nod’s still out there and they aren’t going away anytime soon,” Havoc warned. “One of these days, we’re going to need our walkers back. To go to war without them covering our a**es is a big mistake.” \n Colonel Parker is currently in the process of organizing a petition to retain design plans for continued production of GDI’s mechanized walkers. Short of that, he hopes the manufacturing plans will be retained in GDI’s War Factories and on individual GDI space stations so as to allow for Wolverines, Titans, and even Mammoth Mk. IIs to be deployed at the request of individual base commanders. \n Though the Battle Mechanized Walker Program has been deactivated due to the level of expenses paid to have the program maintained, Juggernaut artillery walkers are still being maintained and actively produced as GDI’s primary self-propelled artillery system."

"GDI field bases have access to three basic static defenses based on the Modular Design Program’s Component Towers. Each tower or platform is designed to counter a specific type of threat, and are listed as follows: the Vulcan Tower, RPG Tower, and AA Battery. Vulcan Towers are equipped with dual 20mm Gatling Guns and are very effective against enemy infantry and light vehicles. Rocket-Propelled Grenade Towers are effective against light and heavy vehicles and are able to fire two guided rounds before having to reload. AA Batteries are ball turrets which operate independently of a Component Tower. They are equipped with twin four-barreled 30mm antiaircraft guns. Each defensive tower’s ballistics computer is able to account for speed, distance, and direction of the target, making them lethal and effective base defensive measures in all scenarios. However, defensive towers operate efficiently only when sufficient power is available. A loss of power will deactivate all defensive towers and leave a GDI position vulnerable to attack."
